<i><b>*CHANGES</b></i>
	<b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>
	- Completely redesigned command processor, enabling the use of multiple character triggers,
          	and several new command issuing formats including the name of the bot and a comma or colon
          	followed by a space, and the removal of a trigger requirement entirely when issued via whisper.
	- The database system has been updated:
                - Database is now controlled in a central repository (Users.txt)
                - The tagbans and shitlist are now represented using flags 'B'.
		- The safelist is now represented using flags 'S'.
                - Cumulative access can now be given using wildcards:
                	- Giving * 0 B, for example, will give all users the ranking of 0 and the flags 'B'.
			- If, assuming that * is equal to 0 B, and another user was added to the datbase
			  	with flags 100 SD, that user would now have the ranking of 100, and the flags 'BDS'.
			  	The flag 'B' comes as a result of the user matching the database entry "*."  However,
			  	'S' overrides 'B,' and, because of this, the user will not be banned.
	- New, more-informative news system
	- The internal custom command system has now been revamped and moved to a plugin provided with the 
		bot (thanks Snap).
	- The internal definition system (define, newdef, deldef) has been moved to a plugin provided with the
		bot (thanks Hdx).

		- Time/date they were added, and by whom
		- Time/date they were last modified, and by whom
		- Use the .dbd / .detail command to get these details out of the bot
	- Improved support for non-standards-compliant SOCKS4 proxies (thanks Raylu)
	- Added support for custom JBLS server messages
	- Tab characters pasted into the text box are translated into spaces
	- Warcraft III Clan traffic from Battle.net is now ignored unless the bot is on Warcraft III
	- Ban Evasion can now be turned off in the Moderation Settings panel
	- The bot can now check for new version bytes using an option in the Bot menu
		- The version bytes are maintained by StealthBot.net staff and will be up to date
			fairly soon after Blizzard patches!
	- The bot will now attempt to guess new version bytes, which are changed when Blizzard patches games
	- Added support for part of Skywing's improvements to BNLS on 1/22/06
		- Namely, invalid logons detected by BNLS are now reported to the user and the bot reconnects
		- More info at http://www.valhallalegends.com/yoni/BNLSProtocolSpec.txt
	- Log files are now stored in the format yyyy-MM-dd.txt, for easier sorting (thanks Draco)

		- For example:	   users.txt=C:\Program Files\StealthBot\users2.txt
	- Updated the BNCSutil library, by Eric Naeseth: http://bncsutil.ionws.com

		- (thanks ZergMasterI)

	- You can no longer write to the Sex field of your user profile due to Starcraft patch 1.15
	- The Plugin System known to scripting users for the past couple years has been integrated into StealthBot
		- This change will only cause minimal changes in your experience -- this involves are mere relocation of code.
		- The setup will be nearly identical to the ver .98 of the Plugin System that you have expected for some time now.
			See the full list of changes here: http://stealthbot.net/p/plugs/changelog

		in a group.
	- The whois command is now distinct from the other database searching commands in that the
	  	whois command will now state a users cumulative rank and/or flags.
	- You can now use //command inside the bot to execute a command with console permissions,
		yet display the response to the channel instead of to your screen. For example,
		//mp3 will spit out Winamp's current song to the channel, while /mp3 will still
		display the song to your screen. This works for all commands.
	- Shitlisting another person now requires strictly greater access than them (thanks Retain)
	- Using a config.ini hack ("AutoModerationSafelistValue") you can now override the access required
		to be safe from automatic moderation features [the default is 20] (thanks Draco)
		This entry should go under [Override] in your config.ini file
	- Commands can be disabled using a new section of access.ini
		- To disable a command entirely, add an entry for it under [DisabledCommands] in access.ini
		- For example, say=1
		- Thanks, Draco
	- You can now control individual access requirements of the .say command using access.ini:
		- say=	  will set the default, restricted "Username says: -message-" type that cannot be abused
		- say70=	will set the less-restricted say which will erase any leading "/" characters on -message-
		- say90=	will set the access required to use an unrestricted say
	- You can now use the variable %me when typing commands. %me will be translated to the username
		of the person executing the command. (thanks Jack)
	- Improved in-bot responses to the .pingme command (thanks Swent)
	- .shitlist <username> is no longer an alias for .shitadd <username> (this is for greater access.ini compatibility)
	- New alias .sl for .shitlist
	- New commands for this version:
		shuffle			requires access 80, toggles Winamp's Shuffle feature
		repeat			requires access 80, toggles Winamp's Repeat feature
		setcmdaccess -a- -b-	requires access 70, changes the required access for your custom command -a- to -b-

		detail -user-   	requires access 60, pulls detailed information from the database about a user
						last modified by/on, added by/on
		deldef -def-		requires access 50, erases the definition -def- that you provide (thanks Draco)
		checkmail		requires access 40, tells you whether or not you have new mail messages
		getmail			requires 0 access but will not respond at all unless you have unread mail
						if you have unread mail, reads you the first message
		shitcheck -a-		requires access 60, tells you whether or not a given user is shitlisted or has flags of 'B'
						alias "slcheck" (thanks Snap)
