 [09:02:49 AM] <PhiX> it was the multi-mod
 [09:03:04 AM] <PhiX> so it does not add to my post count

 [09:12:19 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> reps dont come on for 4 more hours, though =\
 [09:12:25 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Logically, it makes sense, but from experience, that doesn't seem to be true.
 [09:12:51 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Reps also don't know the ins and outs of the Battle.net servers.
 [09:12:57 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> They're just tech support..
 [09:12:59 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i noticed
 [09:13:11 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> They're like you guys are to SB.
 [09:13:12 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ;p
 [09:13:22 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i asked them what the max length a message sent to bnet can be
 [09:13:28 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and he was like "idk"
 [09:13:32 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> (super cool, but ignorant of the inner workings)
 [09:13:36 AM] <PhiX> nice
 [09:13:41 AM] <PhiX> your topic is gone, pyro
 [09:13:41 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> lol
 [09:13:48 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> They wouldn't tell you that if they did know.
 [09:13:53 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> :O
 [09:13:56 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> where did it go?!?!!?
 [09:14:03 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i also asked one what backstage was
 [09:14:04 AM] <PhiX> mianus
 [09:14:08 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> lol
 [09:14:20 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's where the reps cyber.
 [09:14:28 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth [#676803](658) <Keimu> guys | <Keimu> come on lemme back in lol | <Calendros> sorry | <Calendros> You're still banned | <Calendros> come back later | * Keimu (Keimu@ZiRC-A4D4B0A.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has left [more]>
 [09:14:33 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth #AY.Radio>
 [09:14:39 AM] <PhiX> @;;join backstage
 [09:14:41 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [18:55:24] <Pyro6> yea why does /join backstage not work?
 [09:14:52 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [18:55:37] <Pyro6> it says its restricted
 [09:14:59 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [18:56:03] <JonD.Support@Blizzard> Pyro6@Lordaeron: It sounds like you've answered your own question.  Can I help you with something else?
 [09:15:01 AM] <PhiX> RESTRICTED MEANS THERE IS NO MEMBER IN IT
 [09:15:05 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> lol
 [09:15:09 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [18:56:18] <Pyro6> yea but like why is it restricted?
 [09:15:15 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [18:56:45] <JonD.Support@Blizzard> Pyro6@Lordaeron: That's not a technical issue I can help you with.  Do you have any technical support questions?
 [09:15:45 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [19:00:52] <Pyro6> and about that channel, are you hiding something? you seem to be dodging my question that could probably be answered very easily
 [09:15:57 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [19:01:45] <JonD.Support@Blizzard> Pyro6@Lordaeron: We've already been over that issue Pyro so I'll have to move on.  Take it easy.
 [09:16:04 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [19:02:00] Pyro6 was kicked out of the channel by a Battle.net representative (questions answered).
 [09:16:27 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ... well obviously they weren't.
 [09:16:33 AM] <PhiX> yeah, they get paid for kicking loyal customers
 [09:16:39 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> ya srsly
 [09:16:45 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and later on me and jack went in
 [09:16:49 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> he was "hiimjack"
 [09:16:53 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i was "hiimjacksmom"
 [09:16:58 AM] <PhiX> lawl
 [09:17:00 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and we had a conversation with each other
 [09:17:05 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Think about how many times we trash topics of "loyal customers."
 [09:17:13 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i try not to
 [09:17:14 AM] <PhiX> NEVER
 [09:17:15 AM] <PhiX> ERIC
 [09:17:24 AM] <PhiX> but a forum is different
 [09:17:31 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> not really.
 [09:17:31 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> WE DONT GET PAID
 [09:17:38 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> haha, yeah.
 [09:17:39 AM] <PhiX> you can search for already discovered topics
 [09:17:50 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Blizzard has a forum just like that, too.
 [09:17:57 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> blizzard sucks
 [09:18:01 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> er
 [09:18:09 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> the snowstorms
 [09:18:11 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> k?
 [09:18:15 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Technically, there really isn't much reps even need to do anymore.
 [09:18:19 AM] <PhiX> brb reportinng
 [09:18:21 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> DONT BAN ME
 [09:18:28 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I think the only real reason that they keep them on staff is to keep Battle.net from dying.
 [09:18:38 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> woah
 [09:18:43 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> firefox 3 beta 5
 [09:18:49 AM] <PhiX> woop woop
 [09:18:52 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> FIREFOX IS BEING DEVELOPED SLOWER THAN STEALTHBOT
 [09:19:26 AM] <PhiX> where's SB 3.0 then?

 [09:19:36 AM] <PhiX> HM HMMM?
 [09:19:37 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> right there
 [09:19:58 AM] <PhiX> that's not even alpha
 [09:20:01 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I mean, doesn't that seem a bit peculiar?  Technical support being provided on the service in which the user needs technical support with?
 [09:20:28 AM] <PhiX> that's like us giving support on botnet
 [09:20:35 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ;p
 [09:20:40 AM] <PhiX> but uh
 [09:20:44 AM] <PhiX> I think most questions are
 [09:20:48 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Or Clan SBs.
 [09:20:49 AM] <PhiX> "why can't I host?"
 [09:20:49 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ;p
 [09:20:59 AM] <PhiX> why
 [09:21:07 AM] <PhiX> people come with their client to SBs
 [09:21:11 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yeah, which only needs a single web page dedicated to providing support.
 [09:21:15 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, SBs is fine.
 [09:21:34 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Too many other problems occur *after* connection with SB.
 [09:22:22 AM] <PhiX> we need an IP ban tutorial
 [09:22:29 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> people also go to bts
 [09:22:32 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> to report
 [09:22:34 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> people
 [09:22:36 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> for h4x
 [09:22:49 AM] <PhiX> s4x?
 [09:22:51 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> e-mail would be better suited for that.
 [09:23:10 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> All bts does is forward the complaint and respond with the generic, "We will look into the issue."
 [09:23:12 AM] <PhiX> I think reps also use predefined commands
 [09:24:00 AM] <PhiX> can reps be disconnected for flooding?

 [11:00:10 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> yea
 [11:00:11 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> it's ingenious, imo
 [11:00:11 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but its dumb
 [11:00:17 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> oh well
 [11:00:21 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> how owuld you do it?

 [11:01:18 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> -.-
 [11:01:20 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> yay i did something in one line that took you 3
 [11:01:21 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> woot
 [11:01:30 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> psh
 [11:01:37 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Jd[BoT], you're using vb, wtf do you want? :P
 [11:01:47 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> yea but
 [11:01:47 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> ?

 [11:02:41 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> i was missing a simple  quotation
 [11:02:42 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> AND you still did it in a really inefficient way
 [11:02:42 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> there, check that out, VB ASM
 [11:02:46 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> that i didn't take out
 [11:03:08 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> how is is inefficient if it works just as good as the way you would do it?
 [11:03:24 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> because the way i would do it only takes up one line while yours takes up 3
 [11:03:28 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Pyro6, in my professional opinion, I think VB's compiler short-circuits that code into exactly the same as what you said. At least I hope it does.
 [11:03:44 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Then again, I'm not a professional, and neither is VB.

 [11:04:42 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> what is basic
 [11:04:44 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> "basic" is of, pertaining to, or forming a base; fundamental: a basic principle; the basic ingredient.

 [11:05:03 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> er, wil luse VB*
 [11:05:05 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> PEOPLE WITH 2 MB PROCESSORS CARE
 [11:05:08 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> BUT THEN AGAIN

 [11:07:11 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> this isnt english class
 [11:07:16 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> you dont have to cite things
 [11:08:38 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> HOLY SHIT
