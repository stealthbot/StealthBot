 [11:40:19 AM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> minus the flames
 [11:40:24 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I like the idea of having aspects of the bot *outside* of the bot to provide easy updating and modification for users, but I think the plugin system is uneccessary garbage.
 [11:40:54 AM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> then
 [11:40:57 AM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> make a better plugin system
 [11:40:59 AM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ;o
 [11:41:15 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The idea that Swent took an external script and made it a defacto internal standard is absolutely ridiculous -- an obvious attempt to simply have his name put on something.
 [11:41:29 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> thats why i said
 [11:41:30 AM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> lol

 [02:16:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> eric
 [02:16:57 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if you're making a plugin system
 [02:16:59 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> make a timer object
 [02:17:07 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> no gay functions
 [02:17:10 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> scTimer.
 [02:17:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> well, you sound like you dont want to do that for some reason
 [02:17:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Because in doing so, I can't create multiple timers per script.
 [02:18:04 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yea
 [02:18:12 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> thats why i sagklhnabkaerb
 [02:18:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't really know why you would need multiple timers, though...
 [02:18:50 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> my massload plugin uses 2 timers
 [02:18:50 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Set a static Tick and use the same timer for everything.
 [02:19:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's how the plugin system does it, I believe.
 [02:20:14 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> two timers makes things more orginized
 [02:20:25 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and it wasnt really easy to do it any other way
 [02:20:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> since we could only use one scTimer
 [02:20:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm not creating a plugin system, Jack.  I'm allowing users to load multiple scripts.
 [02:20:34 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and not one per plugin
 [02:20:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Well, I can index scTimer internally and give each script its own instance easily.
 [02:21:07 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> a "plugin system" is supposed to load multiple scripts only
 [02:21:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I can't, however, easily give each script its own series of timers.
 [02:21:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> swents "plugin system" does not
