 [03:53:36 PM] <Hdx-Sc> welli thought about adding a warden packet into JBLS
 [03:53:39 PM] <Hdx-Sc> BUT
 [03:53:42 PM] <BinaryBrain> it seems its pretty standard on all wardens
 [03:53:46 PM] <Hdx-Sc> thats kinda moot

 [03:55:14 PM] <Hdx-Sc> better then 4.8
 [03:55:27 PM] <BinaryBrain> does it require a install key or anything, or is it freeware?

 [03:55:42 PM] <Hdx-Sc> umm its not freeware no
 [03:55:49 PM] <Hdx-Sc> i cant remember if it has a key or not
 [03:56:08 PM] <Hdx-Sc> but thats why i said torrent it, all the torrents come with everything if needed

 [09:16:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Coconut water has some laxative qualities, in addition to many beneficial nutrients. You might want to start slowly, perhaps only one, and add a little more each day to see how it affects your system.
 [09:17:08 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> If the liquid tastes sour, its natural laxative qualities may be even greater than normal; don't drink more than one, in that case, unless you desire such an effect on your system.
 [09:17:26 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Someone may object to your taking coconuts from "their" tree, even if said tree is on public land, and even if nobody else is interested in them. Always be prepared to explain yourself to authorities.
