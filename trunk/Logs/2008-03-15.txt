 [02:38:43 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> also, it's not a const number he splits it at

 [02:39:58 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that's 215 characters all on 1 line

 [02:40:13 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> thats 20 on 2 lines
 [02:40:17 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but... it puts 11 characters on the next line
 [02:40:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth 62981784846>
 [02:40:29 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so instead of putting that " [more]" which takes 7 characters
 [02:40:33 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why didn't it just put the last 5 digits?
 [02:41:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You mean 8 digits?
 [02:41:27 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> how'd you get 8
 [02:41:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth>  [02:40:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth 62981784846>
 [02:41:43 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> thats 11

 [02:42:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> im using dsp
 [02:42:42 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and in my bash plugin
 [02:42:52 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> "/me " still counts in the amount your sending to bnet ;o
 [02:42:57 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i added 7 characters for " [more]" and 4 characters for "/me "
 [02:43:06 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth>  [03:44:44 PM] Len{strQuote}=465 (max_number_of_lines * 220) + (11 * max_number_of_lines)=460
 [02:44:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so i guess i should just put 215
 [02:44:06 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> instead of 220
 [02:45:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> still dont understand why 215 characters works fine on 1 line
 [02:45:09 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> but when you step up to 220, it displays 11 characters on the next line
 [02:45:41 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> 220
