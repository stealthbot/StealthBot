 [06:09:20 PM] <Hero.C> Thats on 2.6 R33
 [06:09:26 PM] <Hero.C> Is that something that is fixed on beta
 [06:09:27 PM] <Hero.C> ?
 [06:09:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth [#72633](338) <Logic_BomB> oddest thing said to me all day, i tell a friend not to use plethora in his introduction cause its too wordy sound and he tells me: | <Logic_BomB>  Don't make me open a plethora [more]>
 [06:09:33 PM] <Hero.C> Or is it a Bnet thing
 [06:09:39 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth of cans all which contain some whup-ass>
 [06:10:24 PM] <Eric[nK]> StealthBot creates accounts by first attempting to login the account in question; this results in a failed login.
 [06:10:39 PM] <Eric[nK]> After 4 failed logins, you are no longer allowed to login to Battle.net.
 [06:10:54 PM] <Hero.C> Oh
 [06:11:01 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> i thought it was only temporary
 [06:11:19 PM] <Eric[nK]> It is; you should be allowed to login again after about 15 minutes.
 [06:11:21 PM] <Hero.C> If i try to login to an already made account it makes it though
 [06:11:28 PM] <Hero.C> it logins though*
 [06:11:38 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> hero
 [06:11:41 PM] <Hero.C> Yes?
 [06:11:43 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> if it doesnt get invalid password
 [06:11:45 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> it doesnt exist
 [06:12:06 PM] <Hero.C> Yes I know.
 [06:12:06 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> or one of the other messages
 [06:12:07 PM] <Eric[nK]> Even if it doesn't exist, it will still first try to login & fail to do so.
 [06:12:07 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> it sends
 [06:12:19 PM] <Hero.C> Hmm w/e
 [06:12:20 PM] <Hero.C> I have to go
 [06:12:24 PM] <Hero.C> Thanks
 [06:12:32 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> night
 [06:12:40 PM] <Eric[nK]> failed login -> attempt creation -> login
 [06:12:49 PM] <Eric[nK]> Do that four times, and you can't login.
 [06:12:55 PM] <Hero.C> Ahh
 [06:13:05 PM] <Hero.C> After i get stuck on attempt
 [06:13:12 PM] <Hero.C> it lets me login to a old account
 [06:13:16 PM] <Eric[nK]> ;p
 [06:13:25 PM] <Hero.C> Confusing :)
 [06:13:28 PM] <Eric[nK]> Because you didn't fail to login to the old account.
 [06:13:49 PM] <Hero.C> But I only failed once on the new one
 [06:13:51 PM] <Eric[nK]> It's a strange set of rules, but if you set off the system, 1 failed login = 4 failed logins for each new account.
 [06:13:59 PM] <Hero.C> Lol
 [06:14:04 PM] <Hero.C> Ok then
 [06:14:10 PM] <Hero.C> I'll take your word for it eric
 [06:14:29 PM] <Eric[nK]> So if you set it off, enter your password in wrong on a different account, you will then be locked out on that account as well.
 [06:14:50 PM] <Hero.C> That wears off though?
 [06:14:58 PM] <Hero.C> So I create an account but it does not login
 [06:15:00 PM] <Eric[nK]> After 4, the limit per account is set back to 1 failed login.
 [06:15:03 PM] <Hero.C> then later I will be able
 [06:15:10 PM] <Eric[nK]> Yes, it should be gone after 15 minutes or so.
 [06:15:18 PM] <Eric[nK]> It's similar to an ip ban.
