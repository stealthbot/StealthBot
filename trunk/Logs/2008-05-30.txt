 [07:02:15 PM] <Pyro6> For some reason tonight, I was banned from Clan SBs and Clan Bot by Pyro and Alendar. Now I have actually talked to Pyro before and been fine. In fact, he was the guy who activated my Beta.
 [07:02:23 PM] <Pyro6> I was called a random and banned permanently from the channel. I don't know why, I said hello, and went downstairs, and when I come back I found an impolite message for me in The Void.
