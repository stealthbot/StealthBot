 [11:09:07 AM] <EKLIPz> sup, thanx man, the ppl at bleepingcomputer really helped, so far, i havent had anylag
 [11:09:33 AM] <Alendar> That's good to hear.
 [11:09:56 AM] <EKLIPz> yea, do you know any answers to latency problems from routers?
 [11:10:24 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> when you do a /who, how to you fix the username of the people with ops
 [11:12:22 AM] <Eric[nK]> EKLIPz: The added latency from routers is almost negligible during practical usage.
 [11:12:42 AM] <Eric[nK]> You can't, Pyro.
 [11:12:50 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> then how does /cs do it?
 [11:13:06 AM] <Eric[nK]> It sends both, the name with the brackets and the name without, IIRC.
 [11:13:26 AM] <EKLIPz> Ok, soooo, what your saying is?
 [11:13:27 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> hm
 [11:13:33 AM] <Eric[nK]> Users were once able to make [name], and you still see them occassionally.
 [11:13:46 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> that explains the shitload of "User is not logged on" messages during a cs
 [11:13:50 AM] <Eric[nK]> EKLIPz: That your router isn't likely the culprit in whatever issue you may have.
 [11:13:50 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> *cb
 [11:13:51 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ;p;
 [11:13:53 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> *lol
 [11:13:57 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> -.-
 [11:14:23 AM] <EKLIPz> no, thats not what i mean, im saying that because, from what ive seen, every person with a router, has this same problem
 [11:14:32 AM] <EKLIPz> except the ones who kno how to fix it
 [11:14:41 AM] <Eric[nK]> I suppose it would almost be safe enough now-a-days to send only the name without the brackets; I haven't seen a name beginning & ending with brackets in a long time.
 [11:15:00 AM] <Eric[nK]> EKLIPz: Everyone who uses the Internet uses a router.
 [11:15:08 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> uh
 [11:15:09 AM] <EKLIPz> ive tried portforwarding.com   and the results of that were me having to restore my router and modem to factory settings just to get internet
 [11:15:14 AM] <Eric[nK]> The Internet is nothing more than a series of interconnected routers.
 [11:15:19 AM] <EKLIPz> .....
 [11:15:23 AM] <EKLIPz> ok mr technical
 [11:15:27 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [11:15:28 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> you mean the "latency too high" issue when hosting games?
 [11:15:33 AM] <EKLIPz> yes
 [11:15:47 AM] <Eric[nK]> You'd have to forward ports 6112-6119 to fix that issue.
 [11:15:48 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> forwarding the correct ports on the correct local IP should do the trick
 [11:16:02 AM] <EKLIPz> ive tryed that, and like i said
 [11:16:08 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> also, a personal firewall could be the problem
 [11:16:09 AM] <EKLIPz> it skrewed my router up
 [11:16:12 AM] <Alendar> http://portforward.com/
 [11:16:14 AM] <EKLIPz> ....
 [11:16:16 AM] <Eric[nK]> You did it wrong.
 [11:16:19 AM] <EKLIPz> been there, tried that
 [11:16:20 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> Kaspersky Interntet Security did it for me
 [11:16:32 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> took me a while to figure it out
 [11:16:39 AM] <Alendar is currently: Waking Up Current Project: Stealth-To-Web SQL My website: http://alendar.net :->
 [11:16:50 AM] <Eric[nK]> Windows Firewall is a common troublemaker as well, considering that it's enabled by default on SP2 and Vista,
 [11:16:51 AM] <EKLIPz> i got all the way to the last step, in the router configuration web page
 [11:17:03 AM] <EKLIPz> and had to go to virtual servers, and open ports
 [11:17:09 AM] <EKLIPz> and then my internet stopped wotrking
 [11:17:15 AM] <Eric[nK]> For how long?
 [11:17:39 AM] <EKLIPz> until i figured out what to do, which in my computer slow self, was a month
 [11:17:52 AM] <Eric[nK]> The router will usually have to reboot to apply the changes, which takes a minute or two.
 [11:18:16 AM] <EKLIPz> i talked to tech at my routers manufacturing, i talked to my isp, i talked to further tech, and none of them had a solution
 [11:18:31 AM] <Eric[nK]> What router do you have?
 [11:18:37 AM] <EKLIPz> yea, and when it rebooted, it said that the it had no connection
 [11:18:40 AM] <EKLIPz> belkin
 [11:18:58 AM] <Eric[nK]> model?
 [11:19:13 AM] <EKLIPz> g plus mimo   i think, sumthing of that name
 [11:19:26 AM] <Eric[nK]> That's how it operates, not its model.
 [11:19:32 AM] <EKLIPz> ....
 [11:19:46 AM] <EKLIPz> well, on the site, thats the model name
 [11:20:31 AM] <Eric[nK]> That's not a model name: "G" or Wireless G is the frequency the router uses, and MIMO is a technology for utilizing multiple frequencies at once to create a faster connection.
 [11:20:45 AM] <EKLIPz> btw, everytime i touch any setting in the router configuration now, i lose internet thru the router, i tried changing the name of the connection, and it stopped working
 [11:20:53 AM] <Eric[nK]> The model number is probably on the sticker with the serial number of the bottom of the device.
 [11:20:54 AM] -- SamuelDeuter@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [11:21:10 AM] <Eric[nK]> Why would you change the name of the connection?
 [11:21:18 AM] <EKLIPz> well, if you had said "model number" then id know excatly what yu ment
 [11:21:43 AM] <EKLIPz> because, belkin g plus mimo ######### is a hell of a boring connection name

 [11:26:50 AM] <EKLIPz> then it reboots, i have to manually switch the connection to the new named one, as i do, it loads
 [11:27:12 AM] <EKLIPz> then, when it gets to config screen, top right says NO CONNECTION in red
 [11:27:25 AM] <EKLIPz> but, in network settings, it says im connected
 [11:27:47 AM] <EKLIPz> it does same thing if i try to open ports in the virtual server

 [11:38:46 AM] <EKLIPz> yea, i dont even understand that...
 [11:38:50 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> When you connect to your router wireless, various communication between yourself and your router take place.
 [11:38:58 AM] <Alendar> Eric, could you explain the new optional AddQ parameters?
 [11:39:01 AM] <EKLIPz> yes, i realize
 [11:39:05 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> wirelessly* (why do I keep doing that?).
 [11:39:12 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> `whoami

 [11:39:26 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> eric
 [11:39:31 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> Eric's not
 [11:39:35 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Anyway, when you do so, if security settings are enabled, it requires a specific way of communicating.
 [11:39:52 AM] <EKLIPz> ok
 [11:40:07 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> when you add the first user to the userlist, it doesnt recognize them as added
 [11:40:11 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You're computer will adjust (if it's capable of doing so, and it's not always!), and will send a secret code that your router requires if you configure one.
 [11:40:15 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Your*
 [11:40:45 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> until you reload config
 [11:40:49 AM] <Alendar> !lm
 [11:40:50 AM] <Alendar@Azeroth> The bot has not been whispered since login.
 [11:40:50 AM] <Alendar[BoT]@Azeroth> Last whisper: [1:07:44 PM] <From PyroManiac606> Your friend PyroManiac606 has entered Battle.net.
 [11:40:57 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Your router may have set a secret code without your knowledge, and without that code, you can't connect.
 [11:40:58 AM] <Alendar> O_o
 [11:41:17 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> got that, eric?
 [11:41:22 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm suggesting that you check your router settings for a section where you can configure the "Wireless Key."
 [11:41:37 AM] <EKLIPz> as in, a WPA key, or?
 [11:41:41 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If you delete whatever's in that line and disable the encryption process, it should work.
 [11:41:43 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes.
 [11:42:07 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Pyro: It's whenever any user is added.
 [11:42:19 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> you have to reload ..? thats dumb..
 [11:42:31 AM] <EKLIPz> so your saying, that PERHAPS, when im changing a setting, the router is adding an ecryption against my knowledge?
 [11:42:41 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I believe so, yes.
 [11:42:50 AM] <EKLIPz> ok, creepy....

 [11:43:11 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There's also the possibility of it auto-enabling mac filters, but that seems even less probable.

 [11:43:49 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Alendar: AddQ's Tag parameter allows you to give a queue item a name, essentially.
 [11:44:11 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Then, during Event_MessageSent(), the tag that you added is relayed back and you know that your message has gone through.
 [11:44:48 AM] <Alendar> Priority is used how?
 [11:44:56 AM] <VBScript@Azeroth [+2:46] [Chuck Norris is the only person to ever win a staring contest against Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder at the same time.] [onthefly.no-ip.org]>
 [11:45:15 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> if you send a message with a priority of 1, it will be sent before one sent with a priority of 3
 [11:45:19 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The priority mechanism is unfinished, but it can still work: 0 = highest, 100 = lowest.
 [11:45:32 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Stealth had it backwards.
 [11:45:40 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [11:45:40 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Stealth also didn't have it working.
 [11:45:43 AM] <Ribose@Azeroth> what is thismessage's priority
 [11:45:48 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It only supported priority 1, really.
 [11:46:02 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It will now support them all.
 [11:46:04 AM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i thought that thats how he wanted it lol
 [11:46:14 AM] <EKLIPz> oh and, another odd thing, when i did open the ports(the tech guys thot it was weird)it says no connection, but also tho i am connected contrary to the message, in the fields marked "subnet maske" "default gateway" etc is a
 [11:46:17 AM] <Alendar> OK, I get it now.
 [11:46:25 AM] <EKLIPz> ible with the ecryption thing?
 [11:46:40 AM] <Alendar is currently: Waking Up Current Project: Stealth-To-Web SQL My website: http://alendar.net :->
 [11:46:42 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> moderation commands will be given priority 0, text through the bot 1, and all messages 2.
 [11:47:19 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Actually, I may increase those all by 1 and leave open priority 0.
 [11:47:22 AM] <Alendar is away from the keyboard showering :->
 [11:48:18 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> When that occurred, EKLIPz, did it say that you had an ip address as well?
 [11:48:56 AM] <EKLIPz> ummm, i dont wanna guess, it was awhile ago, but im pretty sure that the ip adress was 0.0.0.0 too
 [11:49:27 AM] <EKLIPz> basically saying that all the connection numbers were blank, but, in my network, i was connected
 [11:49:30 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yeah, that means that you haven't successfully retrieved an ip address from the router; i.e., you were never successfully connected.
 [11:49:40 AM] -- LmaoMan [47ms] has joined the channel using Starcraft Brood War (5 wins).
 [11:49:50 AM] -- LmaoMan has left the channel.
 [11:50:02 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> With that information, you can rule out internet-related difficulties and focus specifically on the router's configuration.
 [11:50:21 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Specifically, encryption protocols and mac filtering.
 [11:50:28 AM] <EKLIPz> yea, thats what i figured, because right now, im connected
 [11:50:55 AM] <EKLIPz> but, i guarentee, if i were to go to open a port, i would no longer have working connecting
 [11:50:59 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Do you have an ethernet cable that you can use to hook your computer up directly to your router?  Or any other computers that are directly connected?
 [11:51:26 AM] <EKLIPz> umm, yu mean my laptop directly to router?
 [11:51:35 AM] -- Jd[BoT]@Azeroth [78ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan BoT)
 [11:51:35 AM] -- Jd[BoT]@Azeroth has acquired ops.
 [11:51:36 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, you can do that
 [11:52:02 AM] <EKLIPz> what would be the purpose of a router if im not using it for wireless?
 [11:52:12 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> howdE doo peeps
 [11:52:14 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> :P
 [11:52:30 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The purpose of any router is to allow you to connect to the internet.
 [11:52:40 AM] <EKLIPz> wirelessly?
 [11:52:47 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The wireless access device built-in to your router is just an add-on.
 [11:53:12 AM] <EKLIPz> new to me btw, but ok...no, i only have 2 ethernet wires
 [11:53:32 AM] <EKLIPz> one is from the modem to router, one is from router to computer
 [11:53:37 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm asking because if something goes wrong wirelessly (and it can become very difficult to setup a wireless network using only wireless devices), you can connect directly to the router and change your settings back.
 [11:54:06 AM] <EKLIPz> the only way ive been able to do it in the past, is to completely restore it
 [11:54:13 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There's no need for a reset: You can enable port forwarding, use your computer that's attached to the router and check for any changes to your setup (wireless encryption key, mac filtering, etc.)
 [11:54:31 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, but resetting it is, like you said, a lengthy procedure.
 [11:54:56 AM] <EKLIPz> well sorry, i gotta clean the house, my stepdad is pissed, ill talk with you a bit later i guess
 [11:55:09 AM] <EKLIPz> maybe a hour or so
 [11:55:13 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If you directly connect, you can play around with settings testing wireless by just unplugging a cable, and changing the settings again just by plugging it back in.
 [11:55:39 AM] <EKLIPz> i see, sounds easier, ill test in a bit, when im done iwht house work
 [11:55:44 AM] <EKLIPz> *with
 [11:55:53 AM] <EKLIPz> peace
 [11:56:07 AM] -- EKLIPz has left the channel.
 [11:56:16 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> Eric, what is the difference between bancount and banlistcount?
 [11:57:04 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> bancount keeps a count of every user banned; banlistcount keeps an approximation of every user currently banned.
 [11:57:17 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> ah
 [11:57:22 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Have you ever heard of Battle.net's ban limitations?
 [11:57:36 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> not really
 [11:57:56 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Battle.net only allows approximately 80 users per op to be banned in a channel.
 [11:58:23 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> When you reach that limit, each successive ban will unban the first person that that user banned.
 [11:58:45 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> (it will do so without a message indicating the fact, of course).
 [11:59:08 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So, banlistcount tries to keep an accurate record of the number of users *actually* banned.
 [11:59:26 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> Since I joined this channel, 45 user(s) have been banned.
 [11:59:30 AM] Ferre7 was banned by PhiX[BoT] (ferre7).
 [11:59:33 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> Since I joined this channel, 46 user(s) have been banned.
 [11:59:38 AM] Ferre7 was banned by PhiX[BoT] (ferre7).
 [11:59:40 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> Since I joined this channel, 47 user(s) have been banned.
 [11:59:45 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> There are currently 43 user(s) on the internal ban list, 5 of which users were banned by me.
 [11:59:51 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> banlistcount also ignores duplicate bans.
 [11:59:56 AM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> yeah
 [12:00:00 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> I figured
 [12:00:09 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Technically, this isn't a problem unless the user changes CD-Keys and comes back.
 [12:00:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If they do, oh well: It's just an approximation.
 [12:00:31 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> ;o
 [12:00:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The internal ban list is used for wildcard unbanning.
 [12:00:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no sense trying to unban Ferre7 8 different times.
 [12:01:25 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> and /banned stores the name of the internal ban list?
 [12:01:30 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> who would unban him even once..
 [12:01:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> mhm.
 [12:01:37 PM] Banned users: Ferre7
 [12:01:52 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The banlist stores details regarding who banned the user now, too.
 [12:02:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I should display that info in the banned command.
 [12:02:27 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> does /cs check the safelist?
 [12:02:32 PM] <PhiX[BoT]> yes
 [12:02:38 PM] <PyroManiac606> mm
