 [11:39:52 AM] <Alendar> Eric, if a my server were to get hacked could other shared computers on my local network get hacked?
 [11:40:39 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If your server has access to them, yes, some data can become compromised.
 [11:41:34 AM] <Alendar> Is there anyway to stop that or is there any program that can let my server run at the same speed and protect it?
 [11:41:59 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You typically set up a server in a dmz outside the permiter of the personal computers outside of the personal network.
 [11:42:13 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You need two firewalls.
 [11:43:21 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Unfortunately, speed and security are mutually exclusive.
 [11:43:49 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The two are inversely related: with increased security, comes decreased speed.
 [11:44:05 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> This is the sad fact of computer networking and there is nothing you can do about it.

 [12:54:26 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> dunno if that's possible
 [12:54:28 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> I want to pimp your tutorial
 [12:54:39 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> oh but you could try tutorial
 [12:54:42 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> but don't do that
 [12:54:42 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> it's not in the search results when I search for "version disabled"
 [12:54:50 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> though it's in the subtitle
 [12:54:55 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> transparent*
 [12:55:02 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> how?
 [12:55:03 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i don't think it'll work
 [12:55:13 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> you could put version disabled in the tiel o.0
 [12:55:25 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> I just wanna have the phrase in the tutorial for search results, it shouldn't be visiable for anyone
 [12:55:31 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ionno
 [12:55:33 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> I did in the sub title
 [12:55:42 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> but it's not under the search resulkts
 [12:55:45 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> results*
 [12:55:57 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> <span style="color: transparent;">version disabled</span>
 [12:56:16 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> it prolly won't work because transparent is usually for backgorund
 [12:56:21 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> if it works, cool
 [12:57:08 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> btw, version disabled usually means they got the wrong exe right now =/
 [12:57:31 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> less likely "account locked" ...

 [12:58:43 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> it's the SetBNLSServer line

 [12:58:50 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> vL's BNLS is being gay

 [04:05:34 PM] <Alendar> Indeed it does.
 [04:05:39 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> he should add the rushers to a dictionary and then do something like
 [04:05:42 PM] <Alendar> My suggestion works better then that.
 [04:05:59 PM] <Alendar> I said add the rushers to the friends list.
 [04:06:01 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> For Each Rusher in Rushlist
 [04:06:23 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and then go from there
 [04:06:36 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> yea, friends list would be better too
 [04:06:57 PM] <Alendar> Yet he adds the person that requests the rush to the friends list.
 [04:07:15 PM] <Alendar> Also he declared: const username = "& Username &"
 [04:07:26 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> that would error
 [04:07:40 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> even if it didnt
 [04:08:11 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> that would make it do soemthing like "/w " & & Username && " blah "

 [07:15:18 PM] <On.The.Fly@Azeroth> yeah but it would be more specific
 [07:15:23 PM] <On.The.Fly@Azeroth> you would go to the link
 [07:15:27 PM] <On.The.Fly@Azeroth> it would have recent messages
 [07:15:30 PM] <On.The.Fly@Azeroth> the users in channel
