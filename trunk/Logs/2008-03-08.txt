 [12:01:19 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> ;)
 [12:01:19 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> and reversed the hell out of it

 [12:02:00 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> thus, he won :P
 [12:02:09 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> so warden is now owned?
 [12:02:15 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> correct.
 [12:02:20 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> That's good news.

 [12:02:50 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> he's got a proxy server he's distributing that users can run to intercept warden packets
 [12:02:50 AM] <Eric[nK]> hm
 [12:02:54 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> uh, stealthbot forums somewhere
 [12:03:05 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> meh
 [12:03:09 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> now you gotta make me go searching
 [12:03:11 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> -.-
 [12:03:15 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> I hate ! lol
 [12:03:27 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Eric[nK], if I compile a C# DLL that exports methods for Warden, would you be interested in using it?
 [12:03:34 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> I plan in implementing it in Felbot anyhow.
 [12:04:05 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> Current MP3 [1/27]: Switchfoot - We Are One Tonight (00:31/04:39)
 [12:04:07 AM] <Eric[nK]> I'm sure Hdx will want to implement whatever he's done into StealthBot.
 [12:04:09 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> mm
 [12:04:21 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Eric[nK], his code is in Java.
 [12:04:40 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> ...
 [12:04:42 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> you idiot joe
 [12:04:45 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> lol
 [12:04:50 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> java can be turned into vb
 [12:04:51 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> -.-
 [12:04:52 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Eh?
 [12:04:56 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> it just takes more time
 [12:04:57 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> lmao
 [12:04:58 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Not very easily.
 [12:04:59 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> :P
 [12:05:03 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> like i said
 [12:05:04 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> ;)
 [12:05:07 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> takes more time
 [12:05:09 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> So, I looked at Hdx's code
 [12:05:21 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> It makes me want to punch babies and nail them to trees, while converting it to C#
 [12:05:26 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> LOL
 [12:05:27 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> !!
 [12:05:28 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> and C# is basically Java .NET, rebranded.
 [12:05:39 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> now to find that topic.
 [12:05:39 AM] <Eric[nK]> I need to completely separate the connection code from StealthBot.
 [12:05:40 AM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> I think he broke his tab key, for serious

 [01:34:30 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> i think the database always has it on
 [01:34:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The database is dependent on your naming conventions.

 [01:37:01 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> IdleBoT, the point is to make this as stable and easy-to-understand as possible
 [01:37:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I agree, that's why legacy naming was originally for -- solving that dilemma.
 [01:37:17 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> If Eric[nK]@Azeroth were in the database as Eric[nK]@Azeroth under ALL circumstances, it wouldn't happen
 [01:37:20 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> eric, you should make it so it checks if idlebot@azeroth exist, and if so, say something like "Do you mean IdleBoT@Azeroth?"
 [01:37:21 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> With legacy naming, you have a universal database across game changes.
 [01:37:36 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> However, if I were to do such a thing without the user's consent, it would only make things more confusing.
 [01:37:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Jack: [01:35:05 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I can add a message indicating that a similar name was found, if it returns nothing.

 [01:39:54 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> i think im #1 on digg or something
 [01:39:54 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> no
 [01:39:58 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> and HOLY SHIT I've gotta get to work, AFK!
 [01:39:59 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> in D2 you see *user
 [01:40:09 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> and you have to add *user
 [01:40:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!!!!
 [01:40:18 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> so switching from D2 to SC would mess up the database
 [01:40:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Legacy naming is a broad generalization for the naming format used on the majority of games.
 [01:40:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So D2 & W3 don't make the cut.
 [01:41:00 PM] <sleathbot@Azeroth> i think we should create an entirely new namespace for gay people

 [02:03:17 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> and on group based responses ...
 [02:03:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Custom responses (which I doubt would be necessary) could be controlled very easily with a script.
 [02:04:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> IsCommand(message)
 [02:04:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> handle the ban, and do a GetDBEntry("name").IsInGroup("blah")
 [02:04:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If so, error out.
 [02:04:54 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> but how would I prevent the bot from saying "that user is safelisted"?
 [02:05:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can disable the original command.

 [02:06:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Actually, I think rather than disabling it, I'm going to provide a "datasrc" attribute that will allow you to specify if a particular command is a script or internal command.
 [02:06:06 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth "sorry we dont sell to racists">
 [02:06:08 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> you don't care about the internal commands
 [02:06:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Do scripts have an event trigger when it's been disabled?
 [02:07:04 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> no
 [02:07:05 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> rofl no
 [02:07:09 PM] <PhiX[BoT]@Azeroth> that's missing, too
 [02:07:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'll add such an event, allowing scripters to re-enable the previous command functionality.
 [02:07:59 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> swent will probably remove it
 [02:08:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Why would he do that?
 [02:08:11 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> saying "thats a waste"
 [02:08:14 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> cuz hes swent
 [02:08:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm taking over the scripting system, if you hadn't already noticed.
 [02:08:38 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> or he'll remove all of the code for it and add his own
 [02:08:52 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> which will probably do a whole bunch of unecesarry shit
 [02:08:55 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> mm good
 [02:09:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> commands.xml integration will remove the need for /phelp related things.
 [02:09:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> & settings.ini, for a large part.
 [02:10:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The plugin system will only provide updating & multiple file loading.
 [02:10:32 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> thats all it needs to
 [02:10:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm considering making SB load multiple files, and leave the plugin system to just updating.
 [02:10:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's for later, though.

 [02:12:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> is it only you working on the bot now

 [02:14:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The only thing Swent is really responsible for is maintaining pluginsystem.dat.
 [02:14:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> which should be removed >_>
 [02:15:05 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> if multiple file loadiing is added internally
 [02:15:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> then the use of it is basically... none
 [02:15:28 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if its adding internally, each one should have its own module too
 [02:15:39 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> mhm.

 [02:44:01 PM] <0x5E@Azeroth :: [23:02:14.109] <striphe@USWest> out of curiosity... how do your support bots work [23:02:27.250] <Tech-PhiX> we connect them :: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 :.>
 [02:44:42 PM] The "whomai" command will state the requesting user's rank and/or flags, and requires either 20 access or flag 'a', 'A', 'C', 'c', 'G', 'J', 'O', 'o', 'M', or 'T'. [Syntax: <trigger>whoami ]
 [02:44:53 PM] The "giveup" command will designate the specified user, and then make the bot
        resign from its role as a channel moderator, and requires either 90 access or flag 'O'. [Syntax: <trigger>giveup ]
 [02:45:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The "whomai" command will state the requesting user's rank and/or flags, and requires either 20 access or flag 'a', 'A', 'C', 'c', 'G', 'J', 'O', 'o', 'M', or 'T'. [Syntax: <trigger>whoami ]
 [02:45:05 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> So from what i see going from SB v2.6R3 to SB v2.7 is gonna be like going from IE to Firefox?
 [02:45:10 PM] <SamuelDeuter@Azeroth> just soo much better?
 [02:45:13 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ...help whoami

 [02:45:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yeah, help hasn't been finished yet.
 [02:45:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> OH GREAT>
 [02:45:43 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ...help settriggerd
 [02:45:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Sorry, but no related documentation could be found.
 [02:45:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> In fact, I'm going to have to rewrite that function to use OpenCommand().Description and such.
 [02:45:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> doesn't help just use commands.xml?
 [02:45:53 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It will be soo much easier.
 [02:46:05 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth -: Now Playing: Mudvayne - Forget To Remember :: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 Development Release 2 :->
 [02:46:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why doesn't help just use iscommand() too?
 [02:46:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, but the way that I was coding it before, every commands.xml related function loaded the xml document, find the command, open each property, etc.
 [02:46:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I have an object for handling all of that now.
 [02:46:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> bash.org
 [02:46:55 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth [#678185] <VsX> i had a great idea for a t-shirt, but part of it is trademarked | <VsX> the front will say "hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil...." | <VsX> and the back will say "but touch and [more]>
 [02:47:00 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I haven't implemented IsCommand() internally yet.
 [02:47:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth taste it ALL YOU WANT">
 [02:47:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i also
 [02:47:59 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> keep forgetting that iscommand isnt what i think it is
 [02:48:28 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [02:49:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i keep thinking iscommand returns true/false if it's a stealthbot command
 [02:49:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> not a "check for proper trigger" type function

 [08:10:43 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> what the hell does that insert?
 [08:10:56 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> It inserts bytes and shit
 [08:10:59 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> ITs an overload
 [08:11:07 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> those are all supposed to be dwords
 [08:11:08 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> if u check the documentation of it
 [08:11:17 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> that whole packet is supposed to be dwords and two strings

 [08:11:21 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> hrm

 [08:15:30 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> oh
 [08:15:43 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> Does it make a difference for AddNonNTString?
 [08:15:45 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> bill gates behavior reminds me of mine
 [08:15:48 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> other than adding an empty byte?

 [08:15:55 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> but if you just adding a bunch of &H0 bytes
 [08:16:08 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> then your packet will be a whole lot longer than it should
 [08:16:16 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> oh
 [08:16:22 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> useless redux
 [08:16:25 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> add

 [08:17:33 PM] <Funnel9111@Azeroth> ok
