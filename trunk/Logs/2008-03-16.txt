 [11:12:45 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> heh, it doesn't even apparently work anyway, then.
 [11:12:51 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I just don't see much purpose for it.
 [11:12:55 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> also
 [11:13:06 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i dont understand the whole purpose of two commands.xmls
 [11:13:10 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Seemed cool, but now that I'm adding namespaces, it just seems like something useless causing people to type more.
 [11:13:24 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You mean two "namespaces?"
 [11:13:31 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> http://www.stealthbot.net/board/index.php?showtopic=31761
 [11:13:55 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> oh yea
 [11:13:56 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> sure
 [11:13:57 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> eric, do you find it wise to leave how to do the exploit in that topic?
 [11:14:02 AM] <VBScript@Azeroth .: Chuck Norris can split the atom. With his bare hands. :: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 Dev Release 3 :.>
 [11:14:08 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes.
 [11:14:31 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> also
 [11:14:33 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> k
 [11:14:38 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why is internal and external strings
 [11:14:42 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> what else is there?
 [11:14:44 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There have only been 30 downloads.  I've removed the ability for anyone else to download it, and I've advised users not to download it.  It's the beta testers right to now.
 [11:14:59 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> mmk
 [11:15:01 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Jack: it corresponds to command attributes.
 [11:15:06 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i dont trust half the beta testers, though
 [11:15:11 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> particularly hale
 [11:15:14 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> "external" = <command name="bleh" datasrc="external">
 [11:15:27 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> true/flase would be faster and easier to type
 [11:15:48 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> also it relates to the whole "inBot" boolean in the Commands() function
