 [04:51:27 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ><
 [04:51:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> yay for the romance languages all having nearly identical syntactical structure.
 [04:52:02 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ye if a spanish and italion meet
 [04:52:15 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> i wonder how long it would take for them to understand that they dont speak the same
 [04:52:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> instantly.
 [04:52:35 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ok...
 [04:52:37 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> mr. all knowing

 [04:53:21 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> >.<
 [04:53:28 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ok so what if they meet
 [04:53:32 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> and they dont speak for 5 mins
 [04:53:37 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ahahhaha
 [04:53:54 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> btw
 [04:53:59 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> why do they call those romance languages
 [04:54:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's easy to distinguish a person of European ethnicity from one of Hispanic.
 [04:54:09 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ..
 [04:54:12 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> i meant from spain
 [04:54:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> They're derived from Latin.
 [04:54:25 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> dont they look the same
 [04:54:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> romancie was what our word "romance" came from.
 [04:54:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> romancie meant essentially "to speak Roman."
 [04:54:53 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> hmm
 [04:54:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The language of the Romans was Latin.
 [04:55:00 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> i wonder if i could get him to do my homework
 [04:55:02 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ^^
 [04:55:28 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Latin -> French, Italian, Spanish and to an extent English.
 [04:55:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> English, though, was more directly derived from an older form of German.
 [04:55:46 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> ok but
 [04:55:48 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> if a
 [04:55:51 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> person from spain
 [04:55:55 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> nvm
 [04:55:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> IIRC, about 25% of our words come from Latin.
 [04:55:56 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> lol
 [04:56:00 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> OK
 [04:56:31 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> go no...

 [07:51:25 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Yep.
 [07:51:28 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Mine does that.
 [07:51:32 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> no it doesnt.
 [07:51:46 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Secret isn't as strong as Enc right?
 [07:51:52 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i cant remember
 [07:51:59 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but secret lets you give commands
 [07:52:01 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> It would appear so.
 [07:52:06 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> And it can also encrypt/decrypt small pieces of my message if so desired.
 [07:52:28 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> you still cant issue commands to a bot and have the response encrypted with your plugin
 [07:52:31 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> So what do you think of my topic plugin?
 [07:52:38 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Yes I can.
 [07:52:47 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> no, you cant. lol
 [07:52:52 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> No, I can't.
 [07:52:55 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Not yet anyways.
 [07:53:03 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Once beta is released.
 [07:53:13 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> yes, but it hasn't. so you cant
 [07:53:25 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth remakes the command system.>
 [07:53:31 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> In fact I can.
 [07:53:37 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> no you cant
 [07:53:38 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> lol
 [07:54:06 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> I can disable every command...
 [07:54:27 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> And overwrite the command subroutine
 [07:54:34 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> function w/e
 [07:54:37 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> is that even possible
 [07:54:39 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> I can ban you.
 [07:54:41 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> then you wouldnt be using the actual command
 [07:54:52 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Well...
 [07:54:56 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> you would be using a replacement
 [07:54:58 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Technically your not using the actual command.
 [07:55:04 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> yes i am
 [07:55:07 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> No.

 [07:55:14 PM] <ozark@Azeroth> my bot isn't on
 [07:55:15 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Edited the script.
 [07:55:25 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Made a script to change the thingy.
 [07:55:27 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> !!
 [07:55:29 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> the script receives the encrypted command
 [07:55:32 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Yes.
 [07:55:35 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> decrypts it

 [07:55:45 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but the response is encrypted
 [07:55:51 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> I am going to release channel topic tomorrow.
 [07:55:52 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> So it is not working as a normal bot.
 [07:56:05 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> I have to remove one thing to make it 2.6R3
 [07:56:10 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> it would be the same as me giving the command in english
 [07:56:12 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> lol
 [07:56:16 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> No wait.
 [07:56:22 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> A few things.

 [07:56:51 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> You've gone threw and added two new steps.
 [07:57:01 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Decrypt it and then encrypt the response.
 [07:57:17 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> its still the same command as without the encryption

 [07:59:21 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> you can admit that someone else was right
 [07:59:40 PM] <SmokeDaCaliDoja@Azeroth> Vector is a bit annoying I must admit; but not enough for me to hate him.
