 [01:18:36 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> o.o
 [01:18:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can use the SendMessage() API, if you want to use it through an OCX...
 [01:18:46 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> why have setmousepos then? o.0
 [01:19:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> SetMousePos() is an API as well.
 [01:19:09 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i thought you exposed sendmessage

 [03:50:30 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> So just to clarify, there is a way to shut down a computer with access to a bot?
 [03:51:22 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> i think that there is one
 [03:51:31 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> How do i protect my bot against it
 [03:51:38 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> something to do with /math i think
 [03:51:40 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> yea,
 [03:51:51 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> that's right
 [03:51:54 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> I know you can do odd things with math
 [03:52:02 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> you can exploit math alot in that ver =/
 [03:52:19 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> So i should just make math
 [03:52:23 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> 999
 [03:52:24 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> access
 [03:52:27 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> yes
 [03:52:37 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> Anything else i need to worry about command wise?

 [03:53:25 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> lol.
 [03:53:37 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> it opens a browser to a site
 [03:53:49 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> and with that createobject() you can also run other things
 [03:53:53 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> like shutdown.exe
 [03:54:09 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> major exploit fun :0
 [03:54:22 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> wow
 [03:54:22 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> i think math was the only major one
 [03:54:33 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> so createobject
 [03:54:39 PM] <Ribose-Tech@Azeroth> also make sure /eval is the same
 [03:54:42 PM] <Ace_of-Hearts@Azeroth> u can run shutdow.exe?
