 [01:37:59 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> why
 [01:38:12 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> more good
 [01:38:19 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> not always...
 [01:38:21 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [01:38:26 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> ...
 [01:38:53 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> gimme a good reason to use it over a dictionary
 [01:38:54 PM] <PhiX> DB's in general are better than files o.o
 [01:38:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> + classes
 [01:38:59 PM] <PhiX> faster
 [01:39:08 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> for example
 [01:39:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you do
 [01:39:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Clans.Item("BoT").Data.Item("chieftain")
 [01:39:29 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and it would say
 [01:39:34 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> "Pyro[BoT]"
 [01:39:43 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Clans.Item("BoT").Data.Item("name") = "BoT
 [01:39:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Clans.Item("BoT").Data.Item("added") = "1/1/08"
 [01:41:07 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its also easier on my part
 [01:41:09 PM] <PhiX> you can also use a DB and a class
 [01:41:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i can just do
 [01:41:20 PM] <On.The.Fly@Azeroth [Most tough men eat nails for breakfast. chuck Norris does all of his grocery shopping at Home Depot.]>
 [01:41:21 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> well
 [01:41:24 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> instead of fixed tables
 [01:41:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i can add anything
 [01:41:30 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and it will save
 [01:41:39 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> ?
 [01:41:44 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> for example
 [01:41:45 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> in sql
 [01:41:48 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> aren't you somewhat restricted by what format you choose for the .clan file?
 [01:41:53 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> no
 [01:42:24 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> tables in sql would be fixed
 [01:42:26 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> or at least
 [01:42:35 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> not changable in a way easier than the way i have it now
 [01:42:45 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> really
 [01:43:07 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ClanObj.Add "setting", "value"
 [01:43:15 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> no need to add a new column
 [01:43:25 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> why would you need to do that?
 [01:43:34 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i dont
 [01:43:35 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> you're adding columns at run-time?
 [01:43:36 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i just like it
 [01:43:39 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> no
 [01:43:41 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> if i was using sql
 [01:44:02 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its like a tag
 [01:44:06 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> with individual settings
 [01:44:10 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> if you were using sql you could just use phpmyadmin or similar and add a column
 [01:44:17 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hm
 [01:44:20 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ya
 [01:44:32 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> why would i add a column for a piece of info i only want for a handful of clans?
 [01:44:35 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [01:45:01 PM] <idiatic@Azeroth> ...
