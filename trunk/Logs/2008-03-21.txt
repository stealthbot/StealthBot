 [07:57:06 PM] <Ribose-5> wow thats gg
 [07:57:25 PM] <Ribose-5> chat filteres didnt activate for me
 [07:57:27 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> So, Eric, you should set the threshhold for auto chat filtering to more than will trigger from ddp
 [07:57:30 PM] <Ribose-5> btw
 [07:57:35 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth>  [07:59:31 PM] My C0ck is in your mom's box.
 [07:57:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> more?
 [07:57:39 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> And, not trigger chat filters from join/rejoin
 [07:57:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Why more?
 [07:58:09 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> I meant that set it so ddp doesn't trigger turning them on
 [07:58:11 PM] <Ribose-5> only from join instant leave, not leave instant join
 [07:58:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ddp-related messages should be filtered.

 [08:02:02 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> lol
 [08:02:05 PM] <Ribose-5> joe is there a reason you dont use the ops / blizzard icon
 [08:02:10 PM] <Ribose-5> yea i know
 [08:02:16 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Ops is handled WC3 style
 [08:02:21 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Gold name in the channel list
 [08:02:22 PM] <Ribose-5> i see
 [08:02:33 PM] <Ribose-5> and now blizzard is handled wc3 style: blue name
 [08:02:38 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> I like product icons more than hammers. Much less vindictive.
 [08:02:44 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Faire enough.
 [08:02:47 PM] <Ribose-5> actually its royal blue
 [08:02:49 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth .: Contrary to popular belief, Chuck Norris, not the box jellyfish of northern Australia, is the most venomous creature on earth. Within 3 minutes of being bitten, a human being experiences the following [more]>

 [08:03:01 PM] <Ribose-5> i know, i like that idea too
 [08:03:02 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Hm
 [08:03:15 PM] <Ribose-5> but the @blizzard guys all use TAHC
 [08:03:26 PM] <Ribose-5> which means, crap they get a black icon!
 [08:03:33 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Which icon do you use for chat now?
 [08:03:36 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> The hooded dude?
 [08:03:42 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> I like that icon :)
 [08:03:50 PM] <Ribose-5> no, i'm using the original chat icon
 [08:03:56 PM] <Ribose-5> that just said chat
 [08:03:57 PM] <Ribose-5> however
 [08:04:07 PM] <Ribose-5> i haven't saved it from gimp yet
 [08:04:14 PM] <Ribose-5> so i can change if you find me that icon
 [08:04:47 PM] <Ribose-5> i think the hooded icon is part of the wc3 one
 [08:04:53 PM] <Ribose-5> which is an mpq
 [08:05:01 PM] <Ribose-5> and i dont have an mpq viewer atm

 [09:40:41 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> i go to most channels and they are not so gaily pink
 [09:40:46 PM] <Ribose-5> orly? in ease-of-use it is
 [09:40:51 PM] <Funnel9111[BoT]@Azeroth> mhm
 [09:40:54 PM] <Ribose-5> but that does not mean it is most efficient
 [09:40:58 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> So, I've come to the conclusion that Abe Lincoln was evil.
 [09:41:04 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> JOE NO HE WASNT
 [09:41:07 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> He wore a black hat. Thus, he was a blackhat. Evil.
 [09:41:07 PM] <Ribose-5> ........o.0
 [09:41:16 PM] <Ribose-5> LOL
 [09:41:40 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> In fact, all "gentlemen" of his day were in fact Blackhats.
 [09:41:40 PM] <Ribose-5> wow idiat still has iroxu.com
 [09:41:46 PM] <Ribose-5> what happend to idiat.com
 [09:41:50 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> http://idiat.com
 [09:41:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> .NET can at times actually run faster than pre-compiled machine code.
 [09:41:58 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> it roxd u?
 [09:42:00 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> $idiat

 [09:42:05 PM] <Ribose-5> really?
 [09:42:13 PM] <Ribose-5> thats actually cool eric
 [09:42:23 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> And .NET can be reversed a lot easier when you lose your source code.
 [09:42:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, the Just In Time compiler has many many optimizations to help speed things up.
 [09:42:25 PM] <Ribose-5> however, not on linux =/

 [09:42:39 PM] <Ribose-5> and shit
 [09:42:48 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Ribose, MSIL is JIT compiled, so it runs on par with precompiled executables.

 [09:43:13 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> i do an advanced JIT compile on all my javascript
 [09:43:26 PM] <Ribose-5> except doesn't it do something funky like leave it in half-compiled mode then compile it when you run it
 [09:43:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Exactly.
 [09:43:56 PM] -- raylu [0ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft II (0 wins).

 [09:44:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> CLR > *
 [09:44:39 PM] <Ribose-5> omfg you make me love .net more
 [09:44:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> .NET is taking over.
 [09:44:48 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Eric[nK], some day I'll write a whole operating system in CLR.
 [09:44:53 PM] <raylu> yeah. clr is so damn portable.
 [09:44:54 PM] <Ribose-5> ....
 [09:44:56 PM] <Ribose-5> why?
 [09:44:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Soon, we'll have .NET operating systems.
 [09:45:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> hai eric
 [09:45:04 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> your ops
 [09:45:05 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> But first I'll design a processor to run CLR.
 [09:45:08 PM] <raylu> OSs that use the windows api?
 [09:45:21 PM] <Ribose-5> wont windows 7 be that .net os though?
 [09:45:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The Windows API is being phased on in favor of .NET.
 [09:45:31 PM] <Ribose-5> or isn't vista alreayd
 [09:45:47 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> sensational!
 [09:45:47 PM] <raylu> vista certainly isn't
 [09:45:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Windows 7 won't be, but Windows 8 may be.

 [09:46:10 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Windows 3 had a Java UI style thing going on.
 [09:46:28 PM] <raylu> <Codi> Windows is unprotected sex. Linux is using a condom, the pill, a vasectomy, and the Berlin wall.
 [09:46:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yeah, raylu, the portability concept can be a little bit hard to swallow.
 [09:46:35 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> Eric[nK], any ETA for D6? I'm starting to lose sleep over zeros.
 [09:46:43 PM] <raylu> because it doesn't exist?
 [09:46:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> More or less, it simply means portability on Windows-based machines.
 [09:47:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Then again, you can find a .NET framework for every popular OS.
 [09:47:09 PM] <raylu> you're right. if you redefine portability and claim to be portable, you are indeed correct
 [09:47:23 PM] <raylu> but they have trouble keeping up with the windows implementation
 [09:47:28 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> raylu, try running prebuilt win32 firefox on a PPC distro of NT
 [09:47:35 PM] <raylu> and will get sued for so much as calling themselves .net
 [09:47:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> portability is a multi-faceted term; in this sense, it just means hardware portable.
 [09:47:41 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> That's what we call unportable.

 [09:48:25 PM] <Chris.W> No.

 [09:48:29 PM] <raylu> can a sane person try and maintain his sanity?

 [09:48:36 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Portability 
 [09:48:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth>     The design of the .NET Framework allows for it to be platform agnostic, and thus be cross platform compatible. That is, a program written to use the framework should run without change on any type of system [more]
 [09:48:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> for which the framework is implemented. Microsoft's commercial implementations of the framework cover Windows, Windows CE, and the Xbox 360.[
 [09:48:50 PM] <raylu> o.0
 [09:48:53 PM] <Joe[BoT]@Azeroth> It's platform agnostic? It doesn't believe in God?

 [09:48:55 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> lol
 [09:48:55 PM] <raylu> i can't believe ms actually uses that word
 [09:48:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> In addition, Microsoft submits the specifications for the Common Language Infrastructure (which includes the core class libraries, Common Type System, and the Common Intermediate Language),[3][4][5] and the C# [more]

 [09:49:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> This makes it possible for third parties to create compatible implementations of the framework and its languages on other platforms.
 [09:49:11 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> what is chatfocus
 [09:49:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's wiki, not ms.
 [09:49:26 PM] <Naivete@Azeroth> and more importantly is it a JavaBot-compatible plugin?
