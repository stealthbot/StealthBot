 [02:38:44 PM] You could even read the status of join/leaves from the config, store the status, disable them internally, and then use the stored status to determine if you should display your custum join/leaves.

 [03:52:51 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> fixed it.
 [03:52:52 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How do you mean, Vector?
 [03:52:56 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> But that was weird.
 [03:53:06 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Your icon (peon icon) was dimmer than the rest.
 [03:53:23 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> For some reason.
 [03:53:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> StealthBot has very limited support for "special" characters, but you should still be able to input them.
 [03:53:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> When a user is gray, it is because they have gone idle.
 [03:53:41 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> ah
 [03:53:53 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I know, that's the words next to their icon.
 [03:54:01 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> But their actuall icon itself, not the gray text.
 [03:54:04 PM] <PhiX> hm, could we justz keep the UTF-8 support how it is in 2.6R3?
 [03:54:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Have you read my topic, Phix?
 [03:54:21 PM] <PhiX> yes
 [03:54:35 PM] <PhiX> but removing it completely would suck :[
 [03:54:39 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> UTF-8 support, as it is now, does absolutely nothing.
 [03:54:44 PM] <PhiX> well
 [03:54:46 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, what are you going to do with the COM object for iTunes?
 [03:54:51 PM] <PhiX> it does somthing ...
 [03:54:55 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> cbabsolutly nothing
 [03:54:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You don't receive any benefit; however, there are a few glitches.
 [03:55:05 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> oH?
 [03:55:06 PM] <PhiX> I come from SC
 [03:55:06 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So using it actually makes you worse off than before with no positive gain.
 [03:55:09 PM] <PhiX> when I had my first bot
 [03:55:14 PM] <HaKr[BoT]@Azeroth> cicucbquite a few glitches, actually
 [03:55:19 PM] <PhiX> I was wondering why it sent empty messages sometimes
 [03:55:28 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> cbcuindeed
 [03:55:31 PM] <PhiX> and I noticed it happened everytime it used a special character
 [03:55:45 PM] <PhiX> I turned utf-8 on and could see the messages correctly
 [03:55:50 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> hm.

 [03:57:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If you see a "?" it is because they are using a font that doesn't support the characters being used.
