 [02:20:46 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> hi eric
 [02:20:52 PM] <PhiX> why don't I see join/leraves for people that are banned?
 [02:20:58 PM] <PhiX> chat filters are disabled
 [02:21:05 PM] <PhiX> leaves*
 [02:21:15 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> how does stealthbot know what client users in the void use?
 [02:21:29 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> the same way it knows anything else about them
 [02:21:34 PM] <PhiX> that's easy
 [02:21:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> incoming chat is queued without regard for the chat filter setting.
 [02:21:38 PM] <PhiX> it hacks their CD keys
 [02:21:44 PM] <PhiX> and checks the CD key length
 [02:21:45 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can config.ini override it, however.
 [02:21:45 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> it doesn't give the statstring in FLAGSUPDATE
 [02:21:56 PM] <PhiX> what's the config.ini override?
 [02:21:56 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes it does, Ribose.
 [02:21:58 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> its not even right
 [02:21:59 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> half the time
 [02:22:02 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> or maybe it does

 [02:23:19 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> i need to make some sort of drawlist delay, like it can't drawlist if it has done so in the past second
 [02:23:26 PM] -- connection_lost@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [02:23:37 PM] <PhiX> so changing it to 0 = disable?
 [02:23:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> mhm.
 [02:23:48 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I wouldn't recommend it, though.
 [02:24:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It was enabled by default to prevent the bot from crashing during a floodbot attack.
 [02:24:09 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> it works better for friends and clan list, because its one packet and thus it knows when to drawlist (when there are no more users in the packet)
 [02:24:30 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ughhh
 [02:24:31 PM] <PhiX> yeah well, one ban isn't a flood
 [02:24:52 PM] <PhiX> I didn't even see if Free7 was banned for joining the channel
 [02:25:04 PM] <PhiX> or if it was someone whispering my bot for example
 [02:25:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> No, all messages after a join are filtered for approx. 500ms.
 [02:25:14 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> hmm
 [02:25:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If the user leaves before that time, the messages are dropped.
 [02:25:25 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> mmm the dev releases seem to decrease in changelog size
 [02:25:27 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth>  =/
 [02:25:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> decrease in changes means less bugs and thus sooner to release date.
 [02:25:54 PM] <PhiX> yeah, getting closer to a stable release
 [02:26:02 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> 3 more devs eric ;)
 [02:26:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Before the next stable?  Yeah, about.
 [02:26:26 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm not sure exactly how "stable" I wish for the next stable release to be.
 [02:26:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> By that I mean, I don't know how much I need to complete just yet.
 [02:26:39 PM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> lol
 [02:26:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I want to get the database manager finished, but I don't know if I'll have commands.xml-related things or the user objects done by that time.
 [02:27:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I also would like to do a clan tab object (ugh) before 2.7.

 [03:26:47 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> LOL
 [03:26:51 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> ok
 [03:26:57 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> What did you do to auth?

 [03:27:04 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hi david
 [03:27:10 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> no
 [03:27:13 PM] <Config.ini@Azeroth> ?
 [03:27:15 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> you have no idea how he did it.
 [03:27:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I was under the impression that you already knew how I fixed it.
 [03:27:22 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> You don't know shit, remember?
 [03:27:30 PM] <Config.ini@Azeroth> what?
 [03:27:32 PM] <Config.ini@Azeroth> i'm Ferre7...
 [03:27:34 PM] <Config.ini@Azeroth> ><
 [03:27:43 PM] <The_Prophecer@Azeroth> ok
 [03:27:45 PM] <AiLucy@Azeroth> So are we gonna play a game[:
 [03:27:46 PM] <The_Prophecer@Azeroth> so what dfid in miss out on
 [03:27:52 PM] <The_Prophecer@Azeroth> im making plans with my friend to go to his place tonight
 [03:27:54 PM] <PVT_Church@Azeroth> ALEXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 [03:27:55 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I would have figured you moved BotVars.Username over to another variable on connection.
 [03:27:56 PM] <PVT_Church@Azeroth> ARE YOU THERE?
 [03:27:56 PM] <The_Prophecer@Azeroth> aka i won't be on tomorrow
 [03:28:00 PM] <The_Prophecer@Azeroth> HES MASTURBATING I SAID
 [03:28:00 PM] <Fooly_And_Cooly@Azeroth -: "My name is VASH THE STAMPEDE!! Forgive the lack of warning, but it's time for my daily massacre! If you do not believe I am the real thing, take a good look at me and start freaking out!!" - Vash [Trigun] :->
 [03:28:02 PM] <The_Prophecer@Azeroth> LEAVE HIM ALONE!
 [03:28:10 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> so that way it was impossible to set a new username.
 [03:28:14 PM] <PVT_Church@Azeroth> gr we need another person then
 [03:28:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's exactly how the issue was resolved.
 [03:28:24 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> And you send the login information using the new variavble as the name.
 [03:28:32 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> So, if I only knew that other variable.
 [03:28:34 PM] <Config.ini@Azeroth> Eric[nK], is it possible to bypass, assuming we know that unknown variable?
 [03:28:38 PM] <ILuvDonuts@Azeroth> back
 [03:28:40 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> No.
 [03:28:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> No, Ferre.

 [03:28:49 PM] <The_Prophecer@Azeroth> lmao
 [03:28:49 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> it'd be extremely difficult at best.
 [03:28:49 PM] <PVT_Church@Azeroth> ur playin with us right?
 [03:28:51 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The varaible isn't modifiable via scripting.
 [03:28:52 PM] <AiLucy@Azeroth> I wonder what PVT looks like
 [03:28:52 PM] <ILuvDonuts@Azeroth> uhhh
 [03:28:53 PM] <ILuvDonuts@Azeroth> depends

 [03:29:07 PM] <The_Prophecer@Azeroth> ur playing with us
 [03:29:08 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> so you can change it, but it was already used at logon.
 [03:29:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can AddQ why, exactly?
 [03:29:12 PM] <ILuvDonuts@Azeroth> ..

 [03:29:38 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> BTW, that's a nice idea.
 [03:29:43 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> You can't AddQ it?
 [03:29:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> No, of course not.

 [03:30:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Why in the world would I do that?
 [03:30:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> lol
 [03:30:16 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> How do you expose them, anyway?
 [03:30:29 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I'm just wondering.
 [03:30:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I add the settings object to the scripting object.
 [03:30:48 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hm.
 [03:30:49 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> nice
 [03:30:50 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> One line of code and the object's exposed.
 [03:30:57 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> cool
 [03:31:08 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'm working on exposing the majority of the bot in some form or another.

 [03:32:08 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> directly after the returned result of the username query, botvars.username gets copied to unknownVariable?
 [03:32:18 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> mhm.
 [03:32:23 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Making it impossible to bypass.
 [03:32:39 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Impossible from the scripting system, yes.
 [03:32:58 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> It's possible to bypass still?
 [03:33:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There's currently no such thing as unbypassable software.
 [03:33:23 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I'd rather think that'd be difficult.
 [03:33:25 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Well
 [03:33:28 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> You could hex it.
 [03:33:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The entire program exists on your computer.
 [03:33:33 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> But I have no idea how to do it.
 [03:33:39 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You have the power to modify any aspect of it.
 [03:33:43 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> uhh.
 [03:33:48 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> And unfortunately you're within your legal right to do so.
 [03:33:52 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Doesn't the EULA state otherwise?
 [03:34:00 PM] <Fooly_And_Cooly@Azeroth -: A junkie is someone who uses their body to tell society that something is wrong :->
 [03:34:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> EULAs are rarely considered valid legal documents in the court of law.
 [03:34:24 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hm.
 [03:34:25 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> i c
 [03:34:38 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> That makes valid sense.
 [03:34:47 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I just hit "continue", or "accept"
 [03:34:49 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> :P
 [03:35:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> As do most.
 [03:35:09 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I assume yourself?

 [03:35:31 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Yeah.

 [08:13:13 PM] <Hide[hS]> so they say
 [08:13:13 PM] <TheGaMeYO> not me
 [08:13:14 PM] <TheGaMeYO> rofl
 [08:13:43 PM] <Eric[nK]> oh, user groups, a move to an xml format for command storage, etc.
 [08:14:07 PM] <Eric[nK]> flood bot filtering, priority queue, blah blah blah.
 [08:14:15 PM] <Eric[nK]> I need to make a detailed list of all of the changes.
 [08:14:36 PM] <Hide[hS]> Indeed, do you ever plan to update any of your former projects?
 [08:14:50 PM] <Hide[hS]> I know last year you were talking about a bot that has AI
 [08:14:53 PM] <Eric[nK]> All of my former projects are closed.
 [08:14:53 PM] <Hide[hS]> and senses stuff.
 [08:15:29 PM] <Eric[nK]> I'm debating implementing a neural network for the purpose of detecting spammers into StealthBot; however spamming just isn't as much of a concern as it used to be.
 [08:15:40 PM] <Hide[hS]> well right now
 [08:15:43 PM] <Hide[hS]> as of two days ago
 [08:15:49 PM] <Hide[hS]> war-lords.net made public
 [08:15:50 PM] -- Forbid [47ms] has joined the channel using Starcraft Brood War (5 wins).
 [08:15:56 PM] <Hide[hS]> a loader that bypasses warden
 [08:15:58 PM] -- Forbid has left the channel.
 [08:16:00 PM] <Hide[hS]> lol
 [08:16:01 PM] <Eric[nK]> heh
 [08:16:09 PM] <JoeRodge21> their newbs
 [08:16:25 PM] <JoeRodge21> without vL wiping their asses
 [08:16:26 PM] -- Forbid [47ms] has joined the channel using Starcraft Brood War (5 wins).
 [08:16:30 PM] -- Forbid has left the channel.
 [08:16:31 PM] <JoeRodge21> they wont figure it out again when warden is updated
 [08:16:50 PM] <Hide[hS]> Leaky was one of the first persons to figure it out
 [08:17:00 PM] <newbie> its public all over vL forums.
 [08:17:11 PM] <Eric[nK]> iago was actually the first.
 [08:17:21 PM] <JoeRodge21> thats my point
 [08:17:46 PM] <Hide[hS]> how many people besides filip have a working warden bypasser in C++?
 [08:18:04 PM] <JoeRodge21> who is that
 [08:18:10 PM] <Hide[hS]> l2k-Shadow
 [08:18:12 PM] <Eric[nK]> Hdx made one in Java, IIRC.
 [08:18:17 PM] <Eric[nK]> Everyone has it now...
 [08:18:21 PM] <newbie> probley about 20 people.
 [08:18:36 PM] <PunK> i hope battle.net finally patches this shit one day so nobody is able to login with a bot
 [08:18:40 PM] <Hide[hS]> I actually kind of miss Feanor, he went head on into Java and had a decent Firebot out, though it was still somewhat sloppy
 [08:18:42 PM] <Hide[hS]> then he quit bnet
 [08:19:05 PM] -- ViaL[hS] has left the channel.
 [08:19:08 PM] <newbie> I'm guessing that'll happen when starcraft 2 is released on battle.net servers.
 [08:19:08 PM] <Hide[hS]> PunK
 [08:19:19 PM] <PunK> hola
 [08:19:21 PM] <Hide[hS]> Impossible.. when their is a will their is a way
 [08:19:26 PM] <PunK> lol
 [08:19:28 PM] <Hide[hS]> they probably can limit you
 [08:19:31 PM] <Hide[hS]> to one connection
 [08:19:32 PM] <Hide[hS]> on bnet
 [08:19:35 PM] <Hide[hS]> at a given time.
 [08:19:39 PM] <PunK> no connections sounds good
 [08:19:41 PM] <Hide[hS]> lol
 [08:19:43 PM] <PunK> aside from clients
 [08:19:50 PM] <Hide[hS]> if clients can get on
 [08:19:52 PM] <Hide[hS]> then a bot can
 [08:20:01 PM] <Hide[hS]> you can make a bot mimic the client
 [08:20:01 PM] <Eric[nK]> They won't limit connections any further.
 [08:20:23 PM] <PunK> we will see
 [08:20:41 PM] <Eric[nK]> 8 isn't a random number; it's the number of users capable of playing in a legacy game.
 [08:20:56 PM] <Eric[nK]> They have it setup that way so that users on a network can play on Battle.net together.
 [08:21:40 PM] <JoeRodge21> if they do that connections thing
 [08:21:44 PM] <JoeRodge21> that could cause problems with lag
 [08:21:53 PM] <JoeRodge21> they should not allow more then one connection per account or somethign
 [08:22:17 PM] <JoeRodge21> and disconnect others  that are on it
 [08:22:35 PM] l)K-StoneY was banned by NeggoGaMe (Hated).
 [08:22:47 PM] <Hide[hS]> they already...
 [08:22:50 PM] <Hide[hS]> meh I won't bother.
 [08:22:51 PM] <PunK> lol hide
 [08:23:05 PM] <JoeRodge21> ?
 [08:23:12 PM] <Hide[hS]> I won't bother!
 [08:23:12 PM] <PunK> there are plenty of ways to elimante bots from bnet
 [08:23:18 PM] <JoeRodge21> ok..
 [08:23:28 PM] <PunK> they aren't worried about bots
 [08:23:29 PM] <Hide[hS]> and you can still mimic the client.
 [08:23:35 PM] <PunK> warden was an attempt to get rid of hacking on starcraft
 [08:23:36 PM] <Hide[hS]> im not saying they cant patch it
 [08:23:41 PM] <Hide[hS]> 50 million times
 [08:24:18 PM] <newbie> the sad part is the people that create hacks are just far more advanced then us. 
 [08:24:23 PM] <newbie> :p
 [08:24:24 PM] <PunK> lol, they could just create a math equation that is impossible to mimic
 [08:25:18 PM] -- Fade [11484ms] has joined the channel using Diablo II (Open Character).
