 [04:32:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> meh
 [04:32:44 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> Eric, if you squelch someone on one account while they have another account loaded on the same ip. Thus resulting in both being squelched. Both Addchats (or more if there is more) Should be displayed.
 [04:33:05 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> catch my drift..
 [04:33:16 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> It's done the same way as it is on Battle.net.
 [04:33:20 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> i was i rambling so hard it flew right past everyone :/
 [04:33:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Battle.net sends the squelched message.
 [04:33:34 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> I see.
 [04:33:45 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> Couldn't you check for flag updates?
 [04:33:50 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Yes.
 [04:33:59 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, I could do that, but it would create a lot of uneccessary spam.
 [04:34:37 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> well its not like im going to go into a whole clan of bots and squelch each and every one of them
 [04:34:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> And it wouldn't always be completely accurate; it wouldn't show you the users being squelched unless they were in the same channel as you.
 [04:34:48 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]@Azeroth> i realize that.
