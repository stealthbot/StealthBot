 [01:57:58 PM] <LuC1Fr[BoT]> Queue cleared.
 [01:58:05 PM] <Eric[nK]> Well, I'm working on fixing a lot of the larger bugs right now.
 [01:58:10 PM] <ribose.no-ip> take an allnighter and release it tomorrow
 [01:58:16 PM] <PyroManiac606> how many feet in a lightyear
 [01:58:16 PM] <Eric[nK]> It depends how effectively the testers work, I suppose.
 [01:58:17 PM] <VBScript> No relevant conversion was found.
 [01:58:28 PM] <PyroManiac606> well

 [01:59:36 PM] <IdleBoT> `contact 935
 [01:59:37 PM] <Eric[nK]> Specifically, you're supposed to "brute force" everything I detail in the change log.

 [01:59:51 PM] <PyroManiac606> k
 [02:00:04 PM] <Eric[nK]> That's why Vector made a great beta tester, actually.
 [02:00:04 PM] <IdleBoT> it's like
 [02:00:08 PM] <IdleBoT> we're the only clan tester...
 [02:00:14 PM] <PyroManiac606> because he has no life!

 [02:00:30 PM] <PyroManiac606> yes, vector, we are talking about you
 [02:00:41 PM] <Eric[nK]> "Great" in terms of testing abilities just refers to your ability to find bugs.
 [02:01:01 PM] <PyroManiac606> because he does stupid shit with the bot that nobody else would do
 [02:01:05 PM] <IdleBoT> he "tested" something that was brand new and was full of bugs
 [02:01:05 PM] <Eric[nK]> It may not take a large amount of skill, but that's what makes a great beta tester.
 [02:01:07 PM] <IdleBoT> not hard.
 [02:01:19 PM] <IdleBoT> if you added another 500 lines of code
 [02:01:20 PM] <PyroManiac606> yea
 [02:01:23 PM] <IdleBoT> and didn't test it yourself
 [02:01:26 PM] <IdleBoT> i could find the bugs easily
 [02:01:29 PM] <ribose.no-ip> why are spaces allowed in the db manager

 [04:35:13 PM] <Eric[nK]> yay.  :)
 [04:35:20 PM] <Ribose> nice
 [04:35:33 PM] -- Alendar@USEast has left the channel.
 [04:35:36 PM] <Ribose> how about
 [04:35:48 PM] <Ribose>  .hasaccess(100) or something
 [04:35:51 PM] <VBScript : Chuck Norris uses redhot lava to moisturize his skin.>
 [04:35:55 PM] <Ribose> returns true if they have that much access
 [04:35:59 PM] <Ribose> oh nvm
 [04:36:02 PM] <Ribose> i could ust do
 [04:36:05 PM] <Eric[nK]> False

 [04:36:23 PM] <Ribose> why double?
 [04:36:29 PM] <Eric[nK]> accident.
 [04:37:06 PM] <Ribose> what else with that object be able to do/
 [04:37:13 PM] <Ribose> .entrytype
 [04:37:28 PM] <Ribose> how about .noncumulativerank ;p
 [04:37:45 PM] <Ribose> although i can't see an instance of that being used
 [04:38:12 PM] <Ribose>  [19:40:19.953] (Whisper) <Ribose> hi
 [04:38:16 PM] <Ribose>  [19:40:20.288] That user is not logged on.
 [04:38:47 PM] <Ribose> eric, i have no way to know whether the tagged message was  bounced back with an error
 [04:39:58 PM] <Eric[nK]> neither do I.
 [04:40:14 PM] <Ribose> i could use this as a clue
 [04:40:18 PM] <Ribose>  [19:37:52.805] <From Alendar@USEast> Your friend Alendar has exited Battle.net.
 [04:40:27 PM] <Ribose> however nobodys everyones friend

 [04:42:04 PM] <From Ribose> Eric[nK]
 [04:42:25 PM] <Ribose> in fact i determine that its better ;p
 [04:43:12 PM] <Ribose>  [19:45:20.549] You cannot open or close the Whisper Window while the form is maximized.
 [04:43:17 PM] <Eric[nK]> You can store a tick of the last whisper sent and when you receive a not logged on error, compare the tick and see if it's likely in reference to your whisper.
 [04:43:21 PM] <Ribose> why not? just move all the objects up
 [04:43:50 PM] <Eric[nK]> Do scripters have access to GetTickCount()?
 [04:43:58 PM] <Ribose> i think so
 [04:44:27 PM] <Ribose> although if i didn't i'd just use the timer function
 [04:45:12 PM] <Ribose> getgtc
 [04:45:21 PM] <Ribose> which is an incredibly dumb name
 [04:45:26 PM] <Ribose> 86364475
 [04:45:32 PM] <Ribose> 71271.3
 [04:45:49 PM] <Ribose> what does gettickcount refer to?
 [04:45:52 PM] <VBScript : Chuck Norris can taste lies.>
 [04:45:58 PM] <Ribose> what is a "tick"?
 [04:46:01 PM] <VBScript> The bot does not have any information about a ""tick"".
 [04:46:03 PM] <PyroManiac606> ...

 [05:51:50 PM] <Eric[nK]> GoogleAHHHHHHHH
 [05:52:30 PM] True
 [05:52:33 PM] True
 [05:53:10 PM] <PyroManiac606> ...
 [05:53:12 PM] <PyroManiac606> lol
 [05:54:09 PM] <Eric[nK]> ./exec AddChat vbRed, GetDBEntry("Eric[nK]@Azeroth").HasFlagsOr("S")
 [05:54:10 PM] <Eric[nK]> hm
 [05:55:19 PM] Error: Invalid procedure call or argument in AddQ().
 [05:55:20 PM] <Eric[nK]>          If ((UserData.Rank >= Command.docs.RequiredRank) Or _
 [05:55:32 PM] <Eric[nK]>              (UserData.HasFlagsOr(Command.docs.RequiredFlags)) Then
 [05:55:44 PM] <Eric[nK]> hmm.
 [05:55:52 PM] <VBScript : Chuck Norris' smile once brought a puppy back to life.>
 [05:57:07 PM] <Ribose> hasflagsor?
 [05:57:29 PM] <Eric[nK]> "ABC" has any of those flags.
 [05:57:38 PM] <Eric[nK]> HasFlagsAnd -- has all of those flags.
 [05:57:52 PM] <Ribose> which does stealthbo normally use
 [05:57:56 PM] <Ribose> for command
 [05:57:58 PM] <Ribose> s
 [05:58:22 PM] <Eric[nK]> Stealth has a different flagging system.
 [05:58:29 PM] <Eric[nK]> or, had, rather.
 [05:58:35 PM] <Eric[nK]> Stealth used flags as if they were ranks.
 [05:58:43 PM] <Eric[nK]> A = 1000
 [05:58:49 PM] <Ribose> no i mean, 
 [05:58:49 PM] <Eric[nK]> incorrect use of flags.
 [05:59:18 PM] <Ribose> which one better mimics stealthbot's flags
 [05:59:23 PM] <Ribose> hasflagsor?
 [05:59:28 PM] <Ribose> currently i mean
 [05:59:28 PM] <Eric[nK]> Yes.
 [06:00:08 PM] <Ribose> name them .hasflags and .hasallflags
 [06:00:10 PM] <Eric[nK]> HasFlagsAnd() is almost worthless and because of that, I'm debating the various design decisions.
 [06:00:35 PM] <Ribose> so that hasallflags appears to obviously be for all flags
 [06:00:59 PM] <Ribose> and .hasflags appears to be the more important on
 [06:01:01 PM] <Ribose> e
 [06:02:40 PM] <Ribose> wait
 [06:02:52 PM] <Ribose> are you sayig that .docs actually works??
 [06:03:27 PM] <Eric[nK]> hm
 [06:03:30 PM] <Eric[nK]> not yet, no.
 [06:03:38 PM] <Eric[nK]> HasFlag() and HasFlags()
 [06:03:51 PM] <Eric[nK]> hm
 [06:03:55 PM] <Ribose> waot
 [06:04:05 PM] <Eric[nK]> Seems more intuitive that way.
 [06:04:08 PM] <Ribose> can't you do .hasflagsor("AB")
 [06:04:18 PM] <Ribose> so that would be plural =/
 [06:04:55 PM] <Eric[nK]> Yes, but it returns true if it has any of the flags.
 [06:05:07 PM] <Eric[nK]> a flag.
 [06:05:27 PM] <Eric[nK]> "return true if a specified flag is found"
 [06:05:52 PM] <VBScript : You know how they say if you die in your dream then you will die in real life? In actuality, if you dream of death then Chuck Norris will find you and kill you.>
 [06:06:02 PM] <Ribose> wait so the things that require o / O means you can have jsut o?
 [06:06:04 PM] <Ribose> hm...
 [06:06:21 PM] <Ribose> that makes sense
 [06:07:21 PM] <Ribose> why dont you just make the commands.xml scriptable
 [06:07:22 PM] <Ribose> already
 [06:07:30 PM] <Ribose> script-accessable*
 [06:07:48 PM] <Eric[nK]> HasFlag(), HasAnyFlags() and HasFlags().
 [06:07:51 PM] <Ribose> rather than making an xml parsing object
 [06:08:14 PM] <Ribose> or (ugly) a text stream ;p
 [06:08:31 PM] <Ribose> wait wouldnt hasflag and hasanyflags be the same function?
 [06:09:09 PM] <Eric[nK]> Similar.
 [06:09:14 PM] <Ribose> just screw hasflagsand
 [06:09:18 PM] <Eric[nK]> HasAnyFlags() could work on a list of flags.
 [06:09:32 PM] <Eric[nK]> HasFlag() works on a single flag.
 [06:09:35 PM] <Ribose> wouldn't .flags = command.docs.flags work?
 [06:09:40 PM] <Eric[nK]> Therefore, HasFlag() would be slightly faster.
 [06:10:56 PM] <Ribose> not noticably, besides, it would confuse people
 [06:11:06 PM] <Eric[nK]> huh?
 [06:11:20 PM] <Ribose> 3 functions to do 2 things... what?
 [06:11:38 PM] <Eric[nK]> HasFlag() is only included because it's intuitive.
 [06:11:52 PM] <Eric[nK]> I can see Pyro continuously trying to use HasFlag() instead of HasAnyFlag().
 [06:11:59 PM] <Ribose> dbentry.flags = command.docs.flags  (would be .hasflagsand)
 [06:12:25 PM] <Ribose> or using hasanyflag instead of hasanyflagS which you said before...
 [06:12:35 PM] <Ribose> but why pyro?... lol
 [06:12:36 PM] <Eric[nK]> I believe the way I'm doing it is HasAnyFlags().
 [06:12:45 PM] <Eric[nK]> Because Pyro is easily confused.
 [06:12:56 PM] <Eric[nK]> (UserData.HasAnyFlag(Command.docs.RequiredFlags)) Then
 [06:13:20 PM] <Ribose> you just said it was hasanyflags though
 [06:13:34 PM] <Ribose> you should make up your mind before you release it ;p
 [06:14:15 PM] <VBScript> it will pwn
 [06:14:17 PM] <Eric[nK]> Obviously.  That's why you can't access commands.xml, yet.
 [06:14:17 PM] <VBScript> don't worry
 [06:14:27 PM] <Eric[nK]> The design phase is one of the most difficult.
 [06:14:33 PM] <Eric[nK]> implementation is simple.
 [06:14:36 PM] <Eric[nK]> design sucks.
 [06:14:49 PM] <Eric[nK]> I like HasAnyFlag().
 [06:14:55 PM] <Ribose> lol...
 [06:15:01 PM] <Eric[nK]> easy to comprehend.
 [06:15:03 PM] <Ribose> you just liked hasanyflags 
 [06:15:20 PM] <Eric[nK]> HasAnyFlag*
 [06:15:30 PM] <Ribose>  [21:14:55.809] <Eric[nK]> I believe the way I'm doing it is HasAnyFlags().
 [06:15:38 PM] <Eric[nK]> HasFlag(), HasAnyFlag(), and HasFlags().
 [06:15:40 PM] <Eric[nK]> Typo.
 [06:15:52 PM] <VBScript : Life is not, in fact, like a box of chocolates. It is more like a box of Chuck Norris, roundhouse kicking you in the face. And if you receive a box of Chuck Norris, you ALWAYS know what you are going to get.>
 [06:15:55 PM] <Eric[nK]> With documentation, simple!
 [06:17:55 PM] <Ribose> WHOA
 [06:18:06 PM] <Ribose> PROXYSHARE JUST CONNECTED THROUGH BY JBLS
 [06:18:21 PM] <Ribose> my*

 [06:19:48 PM] <Eric[nK]> ProcessCommand() is becoming simpler and simpler!
 [06:20:17 PM] <Ribose> why link m,e there
 [06:20:23 PM] <Eric[nK]> codebox.
 [06:20:33 PM] <Eric[nK]> Presently, that is the only IsCommand() documentation.
 [06:20:51 PM] <Ribose> ... ytou have .args there
 [06:20:55 PM] <Ribose> but its .params
 [06:20:58 PM] <0x5E :: [23:35:44] <Tech-SugarD> You got laid by your brother?!?!? :: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 :.>
 [06:21:17 PM] <Ribose> what would this do
 [06:21:19 PM] <Ribose> Set Command = IsCommand(vbNullString)
 [06:21:44 PM] <VBScript> The statement "2+2" evaluates to: 4.
 [06:22:06 PM] <Ribose> good job vbscript!
 [06:22:25 PM] <Ribose> hes learning his math ^^
 [06:22:27 PM] <Ribose> :P
 [06:22:39 PM] <Eric[nK]> It looks for the next command in the message you gave it last time.
 [06:23:12 PM] <Ribose> couldn't you make thje parameter optional
 [06:23:19 PM] <Ribose> set blah = iscommand()
 [06:24:45 PM] <Ribose> what calls parsecommand in that codebox?
 [06:25:04 PM] <Eric[nK]> You place ParseCommand() in your script and call it from the events.
 [06:25:16 PM] <Eric[nK]> Then you don't have to duplicate code to add command handling for whispers.
 [06:25:22 PM] <Eric[nK]> or emotes.
 [06:25:29 PM] <PyroManiac606> "You cannot move this topic into the same forum, well, you could but there wouldn't be a lot of point"
 [06:25:30 PM] <Eric[nK]> or PressedEnter().
 [06:25:45 PM] <PyroManiac606> actually i cant, because this message keeps me from doing so.
 [06:25:48 PM] <Ribose> lol
 [06:25:52 PM] <VBScript : Chuck Norris drives an ice cream truck covered in human skulls.>
 [06:26:25 PM] <From Ribose> /addquote Chuck Norris drives an ice cream truck covered in human skulls.

 [06:57:33 PM] <Alendar@USEast> Let me fix my sentence.
 [06:57:56 PM] <Eric[nK]> hm
 [06:57:56 PM] <Alendar@USEast> upload a fixed version*
 [06:58:03 PM] <Eric[nK]> Did that work, Alendar?
 [06:58:15 PM] <Eric[nK]> Is your BotNet plugin still all screwy?  ;p
 [06:58:21 PM] <Alendar@USEast> It's Ribose
 [06:58:23 PM] <Alendar@USEast> s
 [06:58:27 PM] <Alendar@USEast> I am fixing it.
 [06:58:44 PM] <Alendar@USEast> I managed to get the dragging and dropping to stop in the userlisting.
 [06:58:56 PM] <Ribose> fuck you
 [06:59:06 PM] <Alendar@USEast> Oh shut up.
 [06:59:21 PM] <Ribose> you jsut asked eric
 [06:59:24 PM] <Eric[nK]> I've made the listview settings for the scripting UI identical to those of the channel list.
 [06:59:39 PM] <Eric[nK]> So it should be easier to do such things in the future.
 [06:59:52 PM] <Eric[nK]> I hate Hdx.
 [06:59:59 PM] <Alendar@USEast> Now the userlisting is underorder there are three users on the same row.
 [06:59:59 PM] <Ribose>         UserList.BackColor = &H000000
 [07:00:01 PM] <Ribose>         UserList.ForeColor = &HAAAAAA
 [07:00:03 PM] <Ribose>         UserList.Font = "Tahoma"
 [07:00:04 PM] <Eric[nK]> Scripting UIs require a *lot* more work.
 [07:00:05 PM] <Ribose>         UserList.FontSize = 8
 [07:00:06 PM] <Alendar@USEast> Two*
 [07:00:07 PM] <Ribose>         UserList.TabStop = False
 [07:00:10 PM] <Ribose>         UserList.View = 3

 [07:00:19 PM] <Ribose>         UserList.ShowToolTips = True
 [07:00:21 PM] <VBScript> eric.
 [07:00:25 PM] <Eric[nK]> hm?
 [07:00:32 PM] <VBScript> does the userlist control use .Items()
 [07:00:41 PM] <Eric[nK]> ListItems().
 [07:00:55 PM] <VBScript> like
 [07:00:56 PM] <Ribose> night
 [07:00:59 PM] <VBScript> .Item.Add()
 [07:01:06 PM] <Alendar@USEast> Pfft.
 [07:01:10 PM] <VBScript> i could just use a dictionary

 [07:04:40 PM] <Alendar@USEast> I managed to fix the user listing by using .View = 2
 [07:04:48 PM] <Alendar@USEast> Though the text gets cut off.
 [07:05:12 PM] <Eric[nK]> You'll have to set column widths.
 [07:05:31 PM] <Alendar@USEast> How would I go about doing that?

 [07:57:37 PM] <Eric[nK]> hm
 [07:57:44 PM] <IdleBoT> eric
 [07:57:47 PM] <IdleBoT> you messed up
 [07:57:50 PM] <IdleBoT> the command function
 [07:57:54 PM] <PyroManiac606> eric!
 [07:58:17 PM] <Eric[nK]> CommandEx() is screwy and I don't know why.
 [07:58:18 PM] <PyroManiac606> can you make phix make 0xFF and PhiX.no-ip.org reconnect, please?
 [07:58:20 PM] <Eric[nK]> Command() is fine.
 [07:58:46 PM] <IdleBoT> no its not
 [07:58:47 PM] <IdleBoT> you messed it up
 [07:58:51 PM] <Eric[nK]> ... how so?
 [07:58:55 PM] <IdleBoT> '// RETURNS: The response string, or an empty string if there is no response
 [07:58:59 PM] <IdleBoT> you made it return a boolean
 [07:59:05 PM] <IdleBoT> i need that string
 [07:59:53 PM] <IdleBoT> so can you add another byval parameter for the return string
 [08:00:02 PM] <Eric[nK]> CommandEx() should be responsible for returning such data, and it's not doing so.
 [08:00:09 PM] <Eric[nK]> Command() calls commands.
 [08:00:17 PM] <Ribose-Tech> it appears to return in the byref Ret
 [08:00:24 PM] <Ribose-Tech> but then it just type mismatches
 [08:00:29 PM] <IdleBoT> command ex is for something else.
 [08:00:45 PM] <Eric[nK]> CommandEx() is for calling a command and getting the result back.
 [08:00:49 PM] <IdleBoT> commandex is to "'// Calls StealthBot's command processor, allowing YOU to specify the user's access"
 [08:01:06 PM] <Eric[nK]> Yes, it's not documented correctly.
 [08:01:14 PM] <Eric[nK]> I don't concern myself with documentation until the end.
 [08:01:17 PM] <Ribose-Tech> there now botnet is completish
 [08:01:26 PM] <Ribose-Tech> i really thought no one cared
 [08:01:29 PM] <IdleBoT> i need a command function that returns the command that returns the string but doesn't addq it
 [08:01:33 PM] <Eric[nK]> Command() is for calling a command; CommandEx() is for calling a command and receiving the result.
 [08:01:36 PM] <Ribose-Tech> then alendar comes around -.-
 [08:01:41 PM] <Alendar@USEast> What?
 [08:01:42 PM] <Eric[nK]> CommandEx() is broken.
 [08:01:48 PM] -- ifndef [109ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon)
 [08:01:55 PM] <IdleBoT> well, make command() how it used to be
 [08:01:57 PM] -- ifndef-tech [110ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan SBs)
 [08:02:15 PM] <Eric[nK]> no.
 [08:02:20 PM] <Eric[nK]> Use CommandEx() when I fix it.
 [08:02:30 PM] <IdleBoT> commandex() is stupid
 [08:02:37 PM] <IdleBoT> and is unneeded if you didnt' change other subs
 [08:02:46 PM] <Eric[nK]> It's not stupid -- it does exactly what you want Command() to do.
 [08:02:54 PM] <IdleBoT> except it doesnt work
 [08:02:59 PM] <IdleBoT> and it doesn't do exactly what i want it to do
 [08:03:06 PM] <IdleBoT> because it returns a boolean, and still addq's.
 [08:03:14 PM] <Eric[nK]> It will.  I wasn't made aware of the issue until now because you fail to do your job as a beta tester.
 [08:03:23 PM] <Eric[nK]> phail.
