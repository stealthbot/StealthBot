 [11:17:45 AM] <PhiX> it shouldn't do it for just one user that is maybe shitlisted
 [11:17:46 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You mean there join/leaves?

 [11:18:07 AM] <PhiX> sometimes I don't even see why they are banned
 [11:18:16 AM] <PhiX> (due to a tagbanned clan etc.)
 [11:18:19 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You'll *always* see there ban messages.
 [11:18:30 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The ban messages aren't queued.

 [11:18:40 AM] <PhiX> yeah, that doesn't help me though
 [11:18:44 AM] <PhiX> I wanna see the join/leaves
 [11:18:49 AM] <PhiX> if it's only one user
 [11:18:56 AM] <PhiX> that's not a flood
 [11:19:11 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If Battle.net wasn't bugged, I could display queue contents on ban.
 [11:19:23 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It is, though.  ><
 [11:19:43 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So I never really know whom exactly had been banned.
 [11:20:07 AM] <PhiX> what does that have to do with the join/leave messages?
 [11:20:37 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> When I receive a ban, I can display the contents of the incoming chat queue... if I knew for sure who was being banned.
 [11:21:14 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> recv: "blah was banned." -> display join/leaves/talks -> display ban message

 [12:09:04 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> #exec srHold = False
 [12:09:42 PM] <PhiX> lol
 [12:09:46 PM] <PhiX> your load plugin
 [12:09:52 PM] <PhiX> just banned the beaner
 [12:11:13 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> haha
 [12:11:22 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> well he had to many accounts join to quickly
 [12:12:17 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i should add client detection to that
 [12:12:21 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> meh ill do it later
 [12:12:56 PM] <PhiX> MY IDEA
 [12:13:36 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> btw
 [12:13:44 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> dont EVER private this channel
 [12:13:46 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> ever.
 [12:14:36 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> not that we get loaded/flooded that often
 [12:14:43 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but just if we do, dont do it
 [12:14:59 PM] <PhiX> why not?
 [12:15:12 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> because thats like the ultimate noob thing to do
 [12:15:17 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> privating and filling
 [12:15:35 PM] <PhiX> idc if that's considered "noob" in the "warring scene"
 [12:15:49 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> yes but it only makes more people want to do it
 [12:15:50 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> lol
 [12:16:07 PM] <PhiX> then we will have a permanently private channel :)
 [12:16:16 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> ew @ that
 [12:16:18 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> ;p
 [12:16:26 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> cuz if one person loads, we private
 [12:16:30 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> they post on bnetdev
 [12:16:41 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> then everyones like "LOL NOOB CLAN LETS LOAD IT MORE"
 [12:18:34 PM] <PhiX> even clan war uses c priv
 [12:18:46 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and clan war gets loaded a LOT
 [12:19:04 PM] <PhiX> I talked to marshall
 [12:19:15 PM] <PhiX> and he said "we dont care we are a gaming clan and need the channels"
 [12:19:27 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> well we aren't a gaming clan
 [12:19:35 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> ;o
 [12:19:59 PM] <PhiX> it's still annoying
 [12:20:22 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> chat filters
 [12:20:59 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> its more annoying having them come back every day anyways
 [12:21:26 PM] <PhiX> I doubt they'll come back every day
 [12:21:41 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> every other day*
 [12:22:34 PM] <LoyaLx@Azeroth> Pyro6
 [12:22:40 PM] <LoyaLx@Azeroth> I got loaded yesterday
 [12:22:44 PM] <LoyaLx@Azeroth> With 14 ops up
 [12:22:47 PM] <LoyaLx@Azeroth> It was hilarious.
 [12:22:52 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i bet
 [12:22:54 PM] <LoyaLx@Azeroth> I used pingban and won.
 [12:22:56 PM] <LoyaLx@Azeroth> :)
 [12:23:10 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> we dont have pingban
 [12:23:20 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> or l2uhless for that matter
 [12:23:26 PM] <LoyaLx@Azeroth> lawl
 [12:23:30 PM] <LoyaLx@Azeroth> its glitchy anyways
 [12:23:32 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> we have stealthbot
 [12:23:35 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> so uh
