 [01:36:20 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> you know what I mean by namespaces

 [05:30:14 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> define made a good one
 [05:30:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it would have to go through all your clan pages
 [05:30:29 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> its just.. hes not online right now
 [05:30:44 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> 6 clan pages at 5mb/sec = 20 secs
 [05:30:45 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth is back from (Test test test)>
 [05:30:46 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth .: Now playing #396: Dave Matthews Band - Crash Into Me :: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 Dev Release 10 :.>
 [05:31:00 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth is away (kljd)>
 [05:31:30 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> or the bot could do an internal one
 [05:31:35 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> but it would take a week to gather the info
 [05:32:01 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> but it would still have to go thru the bnet pages
 [05:32:05 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> hmmm
 [05:32:19 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Hmm.
 [05:32:28 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> i just need an easy way
 [05:32:34 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> of kicking people that are inactive
 [05:32:36 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> cuz...
 [05:32:41 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> i need to clense my clan
 [05:32:42 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> :D
 [05:32:57 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> disband
 [05:33:00 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and recreate
 [05:33:02 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> no
 [05:33:07 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> then incative people wouldnt be in it anymore
 [05:33:08 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> :D
 [05:33:12 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> 2000 games would go to waste
 [05:33:20 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> then i would lose half my players that are active and good
 [05:33:31 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> oh, you actually play games...
 [05:33:32 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> nvm
 [05:33:34 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> most of my clan is 60%+
 [05:33:38 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> yeah

 [05:35:28 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> you have any ideas on it
 [05:35:41 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Use scinet
 [05:35:47 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> wtf is that
 [05:35:56 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> whenever someone fucking says something to vector
 [05:35:59 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> that he doesnt like
 [05:36:05 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> he thinks i told them to do it

 [05:36:58 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> ?
 [05:37:00 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> even if you have 69mb/s
 [05:37:08 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you can only access 1 at a time
 [05:37:08 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> i know the potential lag
 [05:37:11 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [17:01:11.618] <EleventyYears@USEast> Dude...
 [05:37:12 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [17:01:23.114] <EleventyYears@USEast> You got a fettish of having yoru 'buddies' sing me songs, David?
 [05:37:25 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> but
 [05:37:28 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> i also have a stats command
 [05:37:30 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> that accesses 
 [05:37:36 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> bnet web pages
 [05:37:39 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> and its not too slow
 [05:37:45 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you dont understand
 [05:37:48 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [05:37:59 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> VBS = single threaded.
 [05:38:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> one connection at a time.
 [05:38:14 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> lol i get what your saying man
 [05:38:24 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> could i have it run
 [05:38:25 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> say
 [05:38:28 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> on my desktop
 [05:38:32 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> let it collect the information
 [05:38:37 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> then use a command to load it to my bot
 [05:38:52 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its the same thing
 [05:38:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> just on your desktop
 [05:38:56 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> i know
 [05:39:01 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> but that wouldnt cause me to get ip banned
 [05:39:02 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> :D
 [05:39:05 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> #alzheimers alendar
 [05:39:08 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you wont get ip banned
 [05:39:09 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> o.o
 [05:39:29 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> i have 5 bots running on this connection, and if anyone were to join my channel when that happened it would ip ban me
 [05:39:30 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> type /exec do : addchat vbgreen, 1 : loop
 [05:39:30 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> lol
 [05:39:54 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> oh well
 [05:40:03 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> maybe ill just copy and paste
 [05:40:05 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> ILL DO IT
 [05:40:07 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth>  [08:39:49 PM] <Pyro6> #alzheimers alendar -- ?
 [05:40:07 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> and load it into the bot
 [05:40:08 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> :D
 [05:40:18 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> would that be more plausible?
 [05:40:24 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> just like make a custom command
 [05:40:52 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [20:41:18.780] 1
 [05:40:53 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>  [20:41:18.780] 1

 [05:41:02 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> vb
 [05:41:05 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> would that be better
 [05:41:09 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> cuz it wouldnt take as much time
 [05:41:12 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> and wouldnt lag me
 [05:41:26 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Hmm,
 [05:41:31 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> all i just have to do is copy and paste like two pages and put them into a custom command
 [05:41:36 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> dont worry bout it
 [05:41:40 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> :P
 [05:42:02 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> AHHHH
 [05:42:07 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> no one responds to me :( :(
 [05:42:36 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> acutally
 [05:42:39 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> whats the basic script
 [05:42:43 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> to just read a text file
 [05:44:21 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> pyro
 [05:44:23 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> read this file
 [05:45:20 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> what made that file

 [06:02:36 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ?
 [06:02:48 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> i have a problem
 [06:02:52 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and its pissing me off
 [06:02:56 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> nothing a cock can't fix
 [06:02:59 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> o.o
 [06:03:05 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> :D
 [06:03:07 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> anyways
 [06:03:13 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> http://pyro.no-ip.biz/bot/log.txt
 [06:03:24 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> in the first two blocks
 [06:03:37 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> whats the prob
 [06:03:56 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> everything from byte 9 to the end of the first block is copied to the second block
 [06:04:11 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> at the 4th byte in it
 [06:04:12 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> redim the buffer to 0 before you change it again
 [06:04:21 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> nono
 [06:04:22 PM] <Alendar@Azeroth> Hmm, I don't know what to work on.
 [06:04:23 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> its supposed to
 [06:04:40 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>             For i = 1 To 20
 [06:04:42 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>                 .InsertByte(.GetByte)                           '//(BYTE[20]) Client Password Proof (M1)
 [06:04:43 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth>             Next
 [06:04:53 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> the problem...
 [06:04:57 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> is the last byte
 [06:05:10 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> my packet logger (the logs you see) sees the last byte as BF
 [06:05:16 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but the bot sees it as 00
 [06:05:19 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and copies that
 [06:05:29 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> so it sends the wrong thing and the password gets hashed wrong
 [06:05:30 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and..
 [06:05:32 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> well yea
 [06:05:50 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> is BF correct?
 [06:05:54 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> idk
 [06:06:03 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but thats what the packet logger sees
 [06:06:04 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> what are you logging
 [06:06:18 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> pb
 [06:06:29 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> what game
 [06:06:34 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> war3
 [06:07:00 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> the bot sees
 [06:07:02 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> [9:07:20 PM] DEBUG: BNET -> C: 0x53 : FF-53-48-00-00-00-00-00-78-D6-8D-0E-1B-26-5C-52-47-1C-02-F9-94-AB-2B-8B-98-CC-81-53-5F-89-BF-97-16-28-E5-D9-9A-B9-20-40-75-F2-8C-C9-89-BC-A8-8F-D6-D1-06-1D-F0-6C-35-5F-36-F8-BF-0 [more]

 [06:07:19 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> as the first block from that log
 [06:07:24 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> you know
 [06:07:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the second block
 [06:07:30 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> doesnt have a header
 [06:07:36 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> the second is bnls
 [06:07:59 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> should ask eric
 [06:08:01 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i have no idea
 [06:08:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ;(
 [06:08:11 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> eric!
 [06:11:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [06:11:35 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> k
 [06:11:36 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> http://pyro.no-ip.biz/bot/log.txt
 [06:11:45 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> in the first two blocks
 [06:12:08 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> its supposed to copy the bytes from the 9th byte over
 [06:12:23 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> in the first block, to the 4th over in the second
 [06:12:28 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> which it does just fine
 [06:12:33 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> except for the last byte
 [06:12:43 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> the packet logger sees the last byte as BF, but the bot only sees it as 00
 [06:14:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Have you tried changing 20 to 21?
 [06:14:44 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> there aren't 21 bytes to get from the first one.. so..
 [06:15:04 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> wait .
 [06:15:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Well, obviously, you're off-by-one somewhere.
 [06:15:27 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> lol 64 bytes
 [06:15:32 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> no..
 [06:15:49 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> the bot sees the packet as
 [06:15:50 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> 0x53 : FF-53-48-00-00-00-00-00-78-D6-8D-0E-1B-26-5C-52-47-1C-02-F9-94-AB-2B-8B-98-CC-81-53-5F-89-BF-97-16-28-E5-D9-9A-B9-20-40-75-F2-8C-C9-89-BC-A8-8F-D6-D1-06-1D-F0-6C-35-5F-36-F8-BF-0A-47-47-A7-BB-BD-B4-F6-56-94-EB-9D-00
 [06:15:57 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> but the packet logger sees that last 00 as BF
 [06:16:03 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> which is what its supposed to be
 [06:16:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth .: Now playing #506: Dio - Caught In The Middle :: StealthBot Beta v2.6999 Dev Release 10 :.>
 [06:16:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Integer arrays indices are defaulted to 0.
 [06:16:49 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> and? lol
 [06:16:53 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Just because you see a zero doesn't mean that a zero was read in.
 [06:17:00 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You could still be off-by-one.

 [06:17:13 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> he means your moved to the left one
 [06:17:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> (which you obviously are, somewhere)
 [06:17:23 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and that last zero is default
 [06:17:33 PM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> it doesnt do that in any other packet though
 [06:17:57 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> yeah
 [06:18:01 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> then again
