 [03:45:59 PM] <PhiX>  [23:47:33.413] <PhiX> and we also need params for whois
 [03:46:10 PM] <PhiX> let's say, I have a user, a group and a clan called PhiX
 [03:46:16 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> NO
 [03:46:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> YOU DONT
 [03:46:26 PM] <PhiX> I wanna be able to use .whois phix --group
 [03:46:29 PM] <PhiX> I HAVE
 [03:46:33 PM] <PhiX> well, not a group
 [03:46:36 PM] <PhiX> but I can add one!
 [03:46:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> there needs to be a "shitlist" group by default...
 [03:47:03 PM] <PhiX> huh?
 [03:47:15 PM] <PhiX> flags B = shitlist group
 [03:47:24 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yes but, it needs to be a group
 [03:47:32 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so it doesnt look like my database has 500 users
 [03:47:32 PM] <PhiX> no it doesn't
 [03:47:39 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> when it's only just all people with flags B
 [03:47:41 PM] <PhiX> stop suggesting noob stuff
 [03:48:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> when your shitlist gets to like 500, you're going to be complaining you can't find people 
 [03:48:52 PM] <PhiX> you will still have the users in the database, even if they are in a separate shitlist group
 [03:48:56 PM] <PhiX> AFK, sleeping
 [03:49:14 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you can callapse a group
 [03:49:24 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> make it so "shitlist" is just one single person
 [03:49:28 PM] <PhiX> oh, you mean the db manager
 [03:49:33 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> yes...
 [03:49:42 PM] <PhiX> I was talking about the find command
 [03:49:47 PM] <PhiX> I'm not using the db manager
 [03:49:51 PM] <PhiX> that's for newbs

 [05:41:33 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> why the hell did you put an ordeR?
 [05:41:43 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It has to be that way or the bot can't tell which is which.

 [05:42:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that is annoying
 [05:42:25 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> iscommand sucks then
 [05:42:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Your mother.
 [05:42:37 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> so does your mom!
 [05:42:38 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> omg
 [05:42:38 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> go ahead
 [05:42:56 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> if iscommand is flexible enough for scripts, then why expose it to scripts?
 [05:43:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> isnt*
 [05:43:53 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because "
 [05:44:19 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> "##bash" will return just a quote, "##bash on" will turn bash on, same with off, "##bash time <number>" will set the interval
 [05:44:21 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> phix
 [05:44:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and some other things
 [05:45:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can't use optional arguments if you can't determine which argument is which.
 [05:45:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Scripters don't have this ability with or without IsCommand().
 [05:45:33 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> sure i can.
 [05:45:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How's that?
 [05:46:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it works fine now, it's just your error message that is making this stupid
 [05:46:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Don't use IsCorrectSyntax().
 [05:46:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's still in development... significant development.
 [05:46:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> im not.
 [05:46:46 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i had to add ##bash in commands.xml to get iscommand to work
 [05:46:52 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> therefore it still thinks its a command
 [05:46:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I didn't expect anyone to actually be using IsCommand() yet, since you can't use scripts to create commands.
 [05:47:10 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ... you complained last dev that we weren't using it!
 [05:47:20 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It was different in the last dev ;p
 [05:47:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> when it did nothing!
 [05:48:49 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> is there any way i can use iscommand() and not get the bot to respond that i didnt have the correct syntax?

 [05:49:28 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth consults harder>
 [05:49:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because the script works, it just adds the extra "your syntax sucks"

 [10:10:02 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> fully universal triggers are stupid and just cause spam.
