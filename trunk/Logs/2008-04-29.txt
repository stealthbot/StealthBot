 [07:25:22 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> if i put 64bit vista on it
 [07:25:34 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> i have 1 gig of ram
 [07:26:53 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Vista can run fine on 512 mb of ram.

 [07:28:10 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> well yeah
 [07:28:17 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> but will i be better off with 64 bit?

 [07:28:21 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't really know how you would define "optimal" with that logic.
 [07:28:30 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> cuz i can get ulitmate 64bit 
 [07:28:36 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> i can actually get any version of vista
 [07:28:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If I had 10 gigs of ram, would I consider 2 gigs optimal?
 [07:28:43 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> no
 [07:28:51 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The 64-bit version will run much smoother.

 [07:29:22 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Thats wierd
 [07:29:23 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> how can i find out my proc bit
 [07:29:29 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Eric.
 [07:29:45 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> With the ÿcb ycb thing
 [07:29:53 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> is it supposed to take a bit to load?
 [07:29:59 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Check your system information; you should be able to find it by right-clicking on My Computer and clicking properties.
 [07:30:03 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> Because it started taking a while when I used it
 [07:30:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> huh?
 [07:30:30 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> I have
 [07:30:31 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> it doesnt say

 [07:30:36 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> but i have a 2.0GHZ proc

 [07:30:48 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> When I reloaded script
 [07:30:56 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> I could see the color code ycb for about 5 seconds
 [07:30:57 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If it doesn't say "64" on your processor information, then you probably don't have a 64-bit processor.
 [07:30:58 PM] <Hero.A@Azeroth> then it got bold
 [07:31:30 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You can check the detailed system information by going to Start -> Accessories -> System Tools -> System Information.
 [07:31:38 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> if i had paid my bill for my laptop
 [07:31:43 PM] <t-dawg[BoT]@Azeroth> i would break this thing a get a new one
