 [09:47:19 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Override -> SCHashes doesn't work?
 [09:47:38 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> whats the one for wc3?

 [09:47:44 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> mhm
 [09:48:11 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> so i would do

 [09:50:44 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It'll always do that if you have trouble accessing the site.
 [09:50:50 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> k that works, but what about remote bncsutil?
 [09:50:59 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> :x
 [09:51:00 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So remote hashing *does* work?
 [09:51:23 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> guess so, must of been that i wasnt putting the "\"
 [09:51:53 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I've added a fix for that.

 [11:08:16 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ...
 [11:08:33 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you guys know that the addchat sub doesn't take hexcodes and properly coverts them right?
 [11:08:49 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> thats why 52 made a function to do it...
 [11:10:48 AM] <PhiX> and why is that?
 [11:11:05 AM] <PhiX> http://www.stealthbot.net/board/index.php?showtopic=31347
 [11:11:25 AM] <PhiX> that guy PM'ed me

 [11:12:06 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it doesnt magically do it for you
 [11:12:06 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> he pmed me too
 [11:12:23 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> vbred, vbgreen are all rgb values
 [11:12:27 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> 255
 [11:12:37 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> 65280
 [11:12:57 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> do /exec addq vbgreen & space(1) & rgb(0,255,0)
 [11:14:10 AM] <PhiX> yeah, but why does it change the red and blue values then?
 [11:14:11 AM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> 65280 65280
 [11:14:19 AM] <PhiX> then it should give you an error
 [11:14:22 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> what do you mean
 [11:14:24 AM] <PhiX> instead of displaying a wrong color
 [11:14:34 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because
 [11:14:38 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth>  /exec Addchat vbgreen, &H16CDDC
 [11:14:41 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> that &H
 [11:14:42 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> is a number
 [11:14:46 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> not the correct number.
 [11:15:36 AM] <PhiX> yeah, but the color you see using that &H number
 [11:15:43 AM] <PhiX> is exactly DCCD16
 [11:16:18 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> tell eric to add a coverter function then
 [11:16:18 AM] <PhiX> R and B interchanged
 [11:16:28 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> all you got to do is check for &H
 [11:16:49 AM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> maybe they have a coverter function... thats wrong.
 [11:17:07 AM] <PhiX> that would explain it

 [01:52:51 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth>  [16:54:36.359] <From Bot-Vector> But the SQL has the time stamps as strings, so just change those. It doesn't look like there's an easier way after that.
 [01:53:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth>     AddFormObject "irc", "ircForm", "ircText", 2
 [01:53:14 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> whats wrong with that line
 [01:53:38 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> there are some strange bugs with the form system
 [01:53:40 PM] <Alendar> Hmm, ready, let's test this.
 [01:53:45 PM] -- VBScript@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [01:54:01 PM] <PhiX> asshole
 [01:54:03 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> connection: http://www.stealthbot.net/board/index.php?showtopic=27969
 [01:54:06 PM] <PhiX> I just whispered you
 [01:54:15 PM] -- VBScript@Azeroth [47ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos.
 [01:54:15 PM] -- VBScript@Azeroth has acquired ops.
 [01:54:15 PM] -- Stats updated: VBScript@Azeroth [47ms] is using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan BoT)
 [01:54:20 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> restarted my bot and it worked
 [01:54:23 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ?

 [01:54:37 PM] <PhiX> PhiX[BoT] wasn't red
 [01:54:52 PM] <Alendar> I know.
 [01:55:03 PM] <Alendar>     If Flags And &H20 Then Icon = "Squelched": Order = "g": Prefix = "<span class=""darkred"">": Suffix = "</span>"
 [01:55:04 PM] <Alendar>     If Flags And &H1 Then Icon = "BlizzardRep": Order = "b": Prefix = "": Suffix = ""
 [01:55:07 PM] <Alendar>     If Flags And &H2 Then Icon = "Operator": Order = "e": Prefix = "": Suffix = ""
 [01:55:17 PM] <Alendar> The third line is canceling it out.
 [01:55:19 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> alendar
 [01:55:23 PM] <Alendar> What?
 [01:55:30 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> what about squelched ops
 [01:55:37 PM] <Alendar> I am working on that.
 [01:55:39 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> you should make it not affect order
 [01:55:44 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and just have it affect color
 [01:55:56 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> and if not ops affect icon
 [01:56:33 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> alendar
 [01:56:45 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> how can you make a text box scroll to the newest line
 [01:56:46 PM] <Alendar> What?
 [01:56:52 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> iin vbs
 [01:57:01 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> VBScript
 [01:57:05 PM] <Alendar> I don't know.
 [01:57:05 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> yes
 [01:57:08 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> rtb?
 [01:57:11 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> no
 [01:57:13 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> just a text box
 [01:57:24 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> you could just set the cursor to the end
 [01:57:24 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its in stealthbot
 [01:57:29 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> yeah
 [01:57:32 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> how do you do that in vbs
 [01:57:36 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> is what im asking
 [01:57:53 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ugh, for a textbox control i cant remember
 [01:58:33 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> but i'd try .selstart = len(.text)  .sellength = 0 
 [01:58:39 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> z
 [01:58:41 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> since thats how it works in rtbs
 [01:58:48 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> but it might not be the same
 [01:58:57 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> (stupid unstandardized vb6)
 [01:59:35 PM] <Alendar> It works now.
 [01:59:51 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> Pyro[BoT]: yest
 [01:59:55 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> Pyro[BoT]: test*
 [02:00:04 PM] <Alendar> Ribose, check it out.
 [02:00:06 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> Pyro[BoT]: grr, escape doesnt work
 [02:00:20 PM] <PhiX> now unsquelch me, meanie :[
 [02:00:48 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> he says now unsquelch him,
 [02:01:00 PM] <Alendar> Done
 [02:01:01 PM] <PhiX> check your other bots
 [02:01:12 PM] <PhiX> so you can still read what I'm saying
 [02:01:15 PM] <Alendar> I can't >_>
 [02:01:16 PM] <PhiX> you can't miss any of my words
 [02:01:21 PM] <Alendar> They are on a sever.
 [02:01:24 PM] <Alendar> server*
 [02:01:31 PM] <Alendar> I am to lazy to start VNC.
 [02:01:40 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> vnc is open here
 [02:01:51 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> although no one uses sbshelp any more
 [02:01:53 PM] -- Alendar@Azeroth [63ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan BoT)

 [02:02:33 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hm
 [02:02:52 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> LOL SAM'S OPS?
 [02:02:57 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> hes at the top
 [02:03:12 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> dont let squelch modify oder
 [02:03:13 PM] <PhiX> doesn't mean he has ops
 [02:03:51 PM] <Alendar> I can't...
 [02:03:57 PM] <Alendar>     If Flags And &H20 Then Icon = "Squelched": Order = Order: Prefix = "<span class=""darkred"">": Suffix = "</span>"
 [02:04:08 PM] <Alendar> Hmm.
 [02:04:15 PM] <Alendar> Maybe I am stupid.
 [02:04:26 PM] <Alendar> I dunno.
 [02:04:28 PM] <Alendar> Tell me.
 [02:04:35 PM] <Alendar> Since you're so smart Ribose.
 [02:04:35 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> maybe just put squelched as last statement
 [02:04:51 PM] <Alendar> Then ops will have squelched icons.
 [02:05:41 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> line one:If Flags And &H20 = &H20 Then
 [02:05:53 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> 2:    If Flags And &H2 = &H0 Then Icon = "Squelched"
 [02:05:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> it's scrolltocaret
 [02:06:00 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> if it means anything to you :P
 [02:06:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> "Scrolls the contents of the box to the edge of the caret"

 [02:07:49 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> also make it If flags And &2 = &H0 Or Flags And &H10 = &H0 etc ... until you get all the squelch overriders

 [02:08:08 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> yes
 [02:08:32 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> Control.Width = Form.Width - Control.Left

 [02:42:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> And is both a binary operator and a logical operator.
 [02:42:21 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> yea, so make sure you hacve parenthesis too

 [02:44:12 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> why would you EVER do order = order?
 [02:44:24 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> thats just wasting space o.0

 [07:00:17 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I can fix it so that it does it in the correct order, but doing so without making the modifications that I need to make to make it work *correctly* would increase the chance of flooding.

 [07:01:42 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> eric
 [07:02:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> can't you demote 5 shamans, pause 3 seconds, designate, wait 3 seconds
 [07:02:08 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and then promote again
 [07:02:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Technically, yes, and I've done that before to make a half-assed working setup, but that's still error prone.
 [07:02:44 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> designate and rejoin
 [07:02:55 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ;p
 [07:03:05 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i tried to save on typing
 [07:03:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then command is ddp anyways, not ddrp
 [07:03:53 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> demoting everyone to designate someone and then promote everyone again without rejoining would be retarded in so many ways
 [07:04:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so ddp is a stupid command?
 [07:04:32 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> no, because most ddp commands rejoin

 [07:14:15 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> eric
 [07:14:26 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> shouldn't utf affect those characters?
 [07:14:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How do you mean?
 [07:14:45 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> like, if utf decoding was off
 [07:14:55 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> should i beable to see those charaters
 [07:15:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, providing that you have your system code page set to one that contains those characters.
 [07:16:07 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> should utf on and off produce the same message?
 [07:16:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, exactly the same again, providing that you have your system code page set to one that contains those characters.
 [07:17:23 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> then why on other versions of stealthbot, they were different?
 [07:17:26 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's kind of a complicated concepts.
 [07:17:28 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> concept*
 [07:17:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How do you mean?
 [07:17:42 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> #ci 956
 [07:17:52 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> $ci 956
 [07:17:54 PM] <0x5E@Azeroth> VengeaNce [956] was created on December 9, 2006, has 86 members, and is currently under the command of Fatal. Shamans: Heart, Abyss, Lucifer, TuGz, Yoda
 [07:18:04 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> gah
 [07:18:19 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> that clan has all unique accounts
 [07:18:25 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> probably all owned by the same person
 [07:18:27 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> -.-
 [07:18:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You mean why were certain character prefixed with an A-like symbol?
 [07:18:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> or why certain characters weren't displayed at all?
 [07:19:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> on previous versions of sb, sometimes you would have to enable utf or disable it (i never know) to see those charaterse
 [07:19:18 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> or else it would produce stupid symbols like: http://pyro.no-ip.biz/temp/o0.png in that picture
 [07:19:35 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i deleted that picture already
 [07:19:37 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ;p
 [07:19:40 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth>    
 [07:19:40 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> great.
 [07:20:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The concept of a "character" in the digital world is limited to a set of predefined numbers that refer to a specific character image.
 [07:21:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Unicode/UTF-8 use one set, while your system's default character set likely uses a very different (and very limited) set.
 [07:21:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The previous editions of StealthBot assumed that only a single character enconding was used: If you selected UTF-8, it expected *all* incoming text to be in UTF-8 as well.
 [07:21:49 PM] -- Ribose@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [07:22:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> This created a conflict when a user spoke to you with a different setting (i.e., utf-8 enabled vs. utf-8 disabled).
 [07:22:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The result were missing characters or just strange characters that didn't resemble what the person was actually saying.
 [07:23:37 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> Eric[nK], why would a java applet run smmother if i moved my mouse in circles?
 [07:23:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> smoother*
 [07:23:51 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The beauty of Unicode/UTF-8 is that the main characters (a-Z, 0-9, and a few others) all have the exact same numbers as those in most default character sets (like the one you are typically using).
 [07:24:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you need to add that config hack for autocompletion
 [07:24:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So, you would only notice these issues when using "special" characters outside of this typical range.
 [07:25:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Starting with the dev releases, UTF-8 is always assumed by default, but if a non-Unicode character is found that would have otherwise caused problems prior to the dev releases, the conversion is ignored and it [more]
 [07:25:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> falls back to regular settings.
 [07:25:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So, with the dev releases, UTF-8 on is the safest option.
 [07:26:00 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There is no such "fall-up" when UTF-8 is disabled.
 [07:26:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> kind of neat, kind of confusing, but either way...
 [07:26:43 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> Eric[nK], why would a java applet run smoother if i moved my mouse in circles?
 [07:26:59 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Different means of graphics handling.
 [07:27:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The Java runtimes are entirely operating system-independent.
 [07:27:27 PM] -- Ribose@Azeroth [31ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (Level: 0, icon tier Random, peon icon, in Clan BoT)
 [07:27:35 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> www.stealthbot.net/p/ball/balls.html
 [07:27:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Just a different design, really.
 [07:27:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> when my mouse is sitting still
 [07:27:51 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it doesn't run smoothly
 [07:27:56 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> that is because
 [07:28:05 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> there are events firing when your mouse moves, and it repaints more often
 [07:28:10 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> giving a more smooth look
 [07:28:22 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i have it repainting every 1 ms i think..
 [07:28:31 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and hdx said it looked fine on windows
 [07:28:34 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> when your mouse moves it triggers hundreds 
 [07:29:30 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> wtf
 [07:29:48 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> its sort of flashing
 [07:30:00 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> flicker?
 [07:30:09 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> bad programming too, but still.
 [07:30:23 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> if it is flickering, you are wiping the image and repainting it
 [07:30:32 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> ... bad idea
 [07:30:39 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> need to double buffer it
 [07:31:02 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> java doesnt repaint at the same time
 [07:31:07 PM] <Alendar is currently: Tired Current Project: Code DB My website: http://alendar.net :->
 [07:31:07 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and ribose the "flickering" you see
 [07:31:10 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> is probably the box moving
 [07:31:14 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> and it's supposed to do that
 [07:31:59 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> it doesnt appear to be moving... it just appears to be flickering
 [07:32:11 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> because the balls are hitting it perfectly
 [07:32:26 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> are the balls flickering too
 [07:32:27 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> or just the box?
 [07:32:42 PM] <Ribose@Azeroth> the balls too
 [07:33:14 PM] <ifndef@Azeroth> do you have a Paint event?

 [09:39:35 PM] <VBScript> since these guys seem to be enjoying it so much
 [09:39:41 PM] <VBScript> where can i put my irc plugin on the forums?
 [09:39:49 PM] <VBScript> for beta-only users
 [09:39:53 PM] <IdleBoT> eric can you make it so the commands giveup/ops don't do anything if there are other ops in the channel (or you're not chief)
 [09:40:08 PM] <PyroManiac606> giveup = ddp
 [09:40:09 PM] <PyroManiac606> o.o
 [09:40:18 PM] <IdleBoT> that's why i said "if you're not chief"
 [09:40:24 PM] <IdleBoT> because if im a shaman, i cant demote you guys
 [09:40:24 PM] <Eric[nK]> You can put it in scripting & plugins if you wish, but indicate that it's only for beta users.
 [09:40:26 PM] <IdleBoT> and it's worthless.
 [09:40:35 PM] <VBScript> i see
 [09:40:46 PM] <PyroManiac606>  [00:38:12.921] <PyroManiac606> er, eric will probably say in scripting and plugins

 [09:43:00 PM] <PyroManiac606> or why not just make a sub forum in the beta forum for plugins?

 [11:36:59 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech> at least do youtube..
 [11:37:14 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech> create a new account, find a way to get usernames
 [11:37:16 PM] <ifndef> its easier to exploit stuff in myspace
 [11:37:18 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech> Subscribe to everyone
 [11:37:20 PM] <ifndef> its not well done
 [11:37:29 PM] <VBScript> myspace is weak
 [11:37:32 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech> yeah, which is why myspace sucks.
 [11:37:40 PM] <VBScript> its full of ads too
 [11:37:45 PM] <VBScript> and that fucks up the page

 [11:40:20 PM] <ifndef> when you get it programmaticly

 [11:40:41 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech> you know..
