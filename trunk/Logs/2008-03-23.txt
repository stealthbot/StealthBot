 [04:32:28 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [04:32:43 PM] <PhiX> does SB do the same to prevent double banning for unbanning?

 [04:33:54 PM] <PhiX> ?
 [04:33:55 PM] -- Pyro6@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [04:33:55 PM] <From Pyro6@Azeroth> Your friend Pyro6 entered a Warcraft III The Frozen Throne game called sorry ;).
 [04:33:59 PM] <From Pyro6@Azeroth> nvm
 [04:34:19 PM] <From Pyro6@Azeroth> you can say it in the channel, i can see what you say ;p
 [04:34:24 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> WTF Netol is full!
 [04:34:27 PM] <PhiX> OKAY PYRO
 [04:34:33 PM] <From Pyro6@Azeroth> $say thats right.
 [04:34:34 PM] <0x5E@Azeroth> thats right.
 [04:35:09 PM] <PhiX> Eric[nK]@Azeroth: http://phix.no-ip.org/dl/temp/double%20unbans.txt
 [04:35:23 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no
 [04:35:49 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I could make it do so, though.
 [04:36:03 PM] <PhiX> I think it's not that important, but it would be better
 [04:36:08 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Thank you.
 [04:36:13 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> No problem.
 [04:36:17 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> come to clan dmwu
 [04:36:23 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> so we can talk
 [04:36:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The ops should work together.
 [04:36:25 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> :)
 [04:36:32 PM] -- Joined channel: clan dmwu --
 [04:36:34 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> So.
 [04:36:35 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hello.
 [04:36:40 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I've heard nice features about stealthbot.
 [04:36:43 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hi.
 [04:36:52 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> You put a lot of good features into it.
 [04:36:55 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hey
 [04:36:59 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Scott, go to clan dmwu
 [04:37:05 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> so
 [04:37:07 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> What specifically, have you heard about?
 [04:37:13 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Pyro tells me that tagadd also adds clan bans?
 [04:37:30 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I've seen the "ops:" command.
 [04:37:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.
 [04:37:46 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Clan bans are specifically clan-based.
 [04:37:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> "tag" bans ban based on a matching tag.
 [04:38:02 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I have some beef with the current emthod to add users.
 [04:38:06 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Slight difference.
 [04:38:12 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> .add <clan> B --type clan
 [04:38:12 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How's that?
 [04:38:16 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> it looks ugly
 [04:38:24 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> clanadd <clan> is much better.
 [04:38:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There isn't much I can do about that.
 [04:38:31 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Oh?
 [04:38:33 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> How is that?
 [04:38:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So that users have to rememeber one hundred different commands?
 [04:38:47 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Script it.
 [04:38:50 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hmm.
 [04:38:59 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> the other way is better, I suppose then.
 [04:39:21 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> the fact that designate now automatically ddp's a user with multiple ops in the channel is a nice addition.
 [04:39:29 PM] <From Pyro6@Azeroth> Your friend Pyro6 entered a Warcraft III The Frozen Throne game called im stupid :).
 [04:39:39 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> What other features about stealthbot did you put in?
 [04:39:39 PM] <From Pyro6@Azeroth> LOL
 [04:40:02 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hale bent on an issue that the settrigger command didn't work.
 [04:40:20 PM] -- DarkMage2303@Azeroth [344ms] has joined the channel using Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (Level: 11, icon tier Human, rifleman icon, in Clan TE)
 [04:40:23 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> hello.
 [04:40:25 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> UGH, you're in TE
 [04:40:41 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> W/e works.
 [04:40:59 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric, so is there any possible way to have profiling in stealthbot?
 [04:41:11 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> no.
 [04:41:15 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> hm
 [04:41:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> StealthBot was never designed for such a thing; the entire bot would have to be redone.
 [04:41:29 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> :(
 [04:41:29 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's not happening.
 [04:41:36 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> profiling, like FO?
 [04:41:36 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I understand that.
 [04:41:39 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Yes.
 [04:41:47 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> =o
 [04:41:48 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Actually.
 [04:41:52 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> installing WoW :).
 [04:41:55 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> wouldn't it have to do wtih reading the config file?
 [04:42:08 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Then the file gets re-read into stealthbot on a "profile" change?
 [04:42:23 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Does it work so simple?
 [04:42:27 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> World of WarCraft had to be put no a DVD cd.
 [04:42:33 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> o.o
 [04:42:38 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That's a bit different; that's possible, but also not likely to happen.
 [04:42:52 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Not likely; how so?
 [04:44:46 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> 7% for Installing WoW
