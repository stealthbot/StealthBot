 [10:57:24 AM] <Alendar> I am confused now.
 [10:57:44 AM] <Alendar> I can make my own?
 [10:57:55 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> if you have the source to pvpgn

 [10:58:15 AM] -- connection_lost@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [10:58:15 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> you could make a "SEX" protocol

 [10:59:57 AM] <Alendar> This is so confusing.
 [11:00:35 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> Have you asked yourself why it's so confusing?
 [11:00:50 AM] <Alendar> Because I don't understand any of this crap.
 [11:01:48 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [11:03:07 AM] <Jack)@Azeroth> whats the oppisite of a nova
 [11:03:24 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> what is the opposite of a nova
 [11:03:26 AM] <VBScript@Azeroth> The bot does not have any information about the "opposite of a nova".
 [11:03:28 AM] <Alendar> I am trying to make a TELNET CHAT client.
 [11:03:32 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> what is a nova 
 [11:03:34 AM] <VBScript@Azeroth> a "nova " can mean November. 
 [11:03:39 AM] <Alendar> I don't understand how the protocol works.
 [11:03:39 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> what is a nova --all
 [11:03:41 AM] <VBScript@Azeroth> a "nova" is a star that suddenly becomes thousands of times brighter and then gradually fades to its original intensity.
 [11:03:45 AM] <Alendar> There is no reference.
 [11:03:57 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> thats because liek
 [11:04:02 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> nobody knows how it works o.o
 [11:04:16 AM] <Alendar> Obviously some people do.
 [11:04:17 AM] <Jack)@Azeroth> so whats opposite of that pyro
 [11:04:28 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> IIRC, you just send Chr$(0) & yourName & control + line feed & your pass & control + line feed.
 [11:04:52 AM] <Alendar> So:
 [11:04:54 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Why don't you packet log a telnet connection to PvGN?
 [11:04:56 AM] <Pyro6@Azeroth> what is a star that suddenly becomes thousands of times dimmer and then gradually strenghtens to its original intesity
 [11:05:02 AM] <Alendar> I did that.

 [11:13:37 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> gotcha
 [11:13:42 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> thats awsome
 [11:13:54 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The supernova, based off of my limited understanding, is just any star with a large enough bang to create a blackhole.
 [11:13:57 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> very interesting indeed.
 [11:14:37 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> Don't we already have like one big ass blackhole in our galaxy that keeps our stuff in check?
 [11:14:54 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> I used to watch the science channel n shit so this is what i heard anyways.
 [11:15:08 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The prevailing theory is that all galaxies have a supermassive blackhole at the center of their system.
 [11:15:23 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> hmm
 [11:15:28 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> Yea that's what i heard.
 [11:15:46 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> But has it yet to been proven? Negative :P
 [11:16:04 AM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> However, it's my understanding that what's really keeping the universe "in check" is Chuck Norris.
 [11:16:06 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> So i guess that's hense theory
 [11:16:22 AM] <Jd[BoT]@Azeroth> Oh wow, yea he is the cause of it.

 [01:04:56 PM] <From mynameisnotjack> doesnt work on starcraft
 [01:05:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> There's a reason why chat filters are enabled by default.
 [01:05:01 PM] <mynameisnotjack> i tried enablign chat filters
 [01:05:02 PM] <mynameisnotjack> and joining
 [01:05:05 PM] <mynameisnotjack> but it didnt work

 [01:05:32 PM] <mynameisnotjack> i dont have it set on this bot...
 [01:05:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The ChatDelay is a separate filtering system.
 [01:05:42 PM] <From Pyro6@Azeroth> Your friend Pyro6 has entered Battle.net.
 [01:05:51 PM] <mynameisnotjack> well
 [01:05:54 PM] <mynameisnotjack> it worked fine on idlebot
 [01:05:58 PM] <mynameisnotjack> but not on this bot
 [01:06:03 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Should work on SC as well.
 [01:06:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't know.  I've never tested it.  It's the same design, though.
 [01:06:21 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Should work uniformly well.
 [01:06:23 PM] <mynameisnotjack> TEST IT!
 [01:06:31 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I don't have Hdx's little proxy thing set up.
 [01:06:33 PM] <mynameisnotjack> what should i set chat delay to
 [01:06:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> It's defaulted to 500.
 [01:06:56 PM] <mynameisnotjack> [Other]
 [01:06:57 PM] <mynameisnotjack> ChatDelay=500
 [01:07:10 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> 700 - 1000 should filter almost anything potentially harmful, but it can become annoying.

 [07:01:46 PM] <idiat> i dunno y
 [07:01:55 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you said you fixed it i thought
 [07:02:06 PM] <idiat> i figured out exactly what the problem is but it is not fixed yet
 [07:02:12 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> I FIGURED IT OUT
 [07:02:18 PM] <idiat> ya but i did too

 [07:02:36 PM] <idiat> FINE
 [07:02:39 PM] <idiat> it changes the insertion style to whatever the selected text is
 [07:02:54 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> couldnt you just make it so
 [07:03:03 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> timestamps starts as unbolded each time
 [07:03:24 PM] <idiat> bold uses something like .startbold and .endbold
 [07:03:45 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth>  .endbold + timestamp
 [07:03:48 PM] <idiat> i guess i could be all like .endbold before every addchat
 [07:03:52 PM] <idiat> =\
 [07:04:09 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> EZ FIX?
 [07:04:13 PM] <idiat> i was thinking more like setting the insertion style to some default value if i could find out how
