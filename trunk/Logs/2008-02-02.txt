 [08:11:56 PM] -- Bot-Vector@Azeroth has left the channel.
 [08:12:02 PM] <Ribose> rofl, my sc is completely cd-less
 [08:12:08 PM] <Ribose> i copied both install.exes
 [08:12:19 PM] <Ribose> and can play as sc or bw without the cd!
 [08:12:39 PM] <Ribose> i wonder if i copy the sc folder if i can play on that computer...
 [08:12:46 PM] <Ribose> hmmmmm
 [08:13:18 PM] <Ribose> and since its cd-less, its really fast too, because it never has to read from the cd
 [08:13:34 PM] <Ribose> and i also dont hve to worry about scratching the cd :0
 [08:13:59 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ribose
 [08:14:03 PM] <Ribose> i wish all games were like this
 [08:14:05 PM] <Ribose> what
 [08:14:05 PM] -- Death[swh] has left the channel.
 [08:14:08 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> even when you have to use the cd 
 [08:14:14 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> it only reads from it when the game is starting
 [08:14:51 PM] <Ribose> no, at various times it would read from cd, i think warden checks stuff like that (what's in install.exe)
 [08:14:57 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> no
 [08:14:59 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> it doesnt
 [08:15:06 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [08:15:09 PM] <Ribose> because it used to crash often when it couldn't read the cd
 [08:15:15 PM] <Ribose> like halfway throught the game
 [08:15:16 PM] <connection_lost@Azeroth> isn't vector 22
 [08:15:21 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> yea'

 [08:17:15 PM] <Ribose> look, i'd be playing sc, and like as soon as in-game starts, it would show the stuff (cc with 4 scvs)
 [08:17:19 PM] <Ribose> then freeze up
 [08:17:22 PM] <Ribose> then crash
 [08:17:29 PM] <Ribose> and say "can't read install.exe"

 [10:47:43 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> As you have severely haltered fast rejoining with the new filter ;p
 [10:48:11 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i want an option so that chat filters will NEVER be turned on ;p
 [10:48:32 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> o.o
 [10:48:37 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> even automatically...?
 [10:48:45 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> o.o
 [10:48:47 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> especually automatically
 [10:48:51 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> ah.
 [10:48:52 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> they are annoying, imo
 [10:48:59 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Unfortunately...
 [10:49:11 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> my bot is so slow, I don't get the luxury of the new filters..
 [10:49:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The next version will have them automatically enabled and the option to disable them will be limited to a config.ini override.
 [10:49:31 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Hm.
 [10:49:37 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> not even in bot settings?
 [10:49:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The delay, however, will be brought down to 500ms.
 [10:49:42 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and clan rank related command will be a config.ini override too?
 [10:49:55 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Yeah.
 [10:50:00 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> That's much better.
 [10:50:03 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Because, if you think about it
 [10:50:17 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The scripting system will also be called with from the chat queue functions, so messages will be shown correctly.
 [10:50:17 PM] DarkMage2303 was banned by Pyro[BoT] (IPBanned.).

 [10:58:50 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> :o
 [10:58:53 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> HOw does it work?
 [10:58:58 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> it adds all names to a string
 [10:59:01 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> perhaps
 [10:59:07 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> ... if more than x users join in y seconds
 [10:59:10 PM] <DarkMage2303@Azeroth> how are you suppose to load this channel, 6 bots to ban any flood bots when they join
 [10:59:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> it adds their names to an array
 [10:59:28 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Yeah
 [10:59:29 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> then goes through the array and bans everyone in it
 [10:59:32 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hm
 [10:59:33 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I did that same thing.
 [10:59:43 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Thing is.
 [10:59:47 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I may need to refine it
 [10:59:47 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth>  [10:58:46 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> who made it?
 [10:59:47 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> but before banning it checks to make sure the user is still in the channel, not an operator, and is not safelisted ;p
 [10:59:53 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I originally came up with the concept.
 [11:00:04 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> hm
 [11:00:07 PM] <Bot-Vector@Azeroth> You were the first one, after the first massloader, I figure.
 [11:00:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> SB has promote and demote commands now.
