 [01:37:30 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Eric
 [01:37:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL#Defense i would
 [01:37:46 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> hate that
 [01:37:47 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> so much
 [01:37:57 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I suggest that if you are a root administrator, and I believe you are, you should get FTP access to stealthbot.net, and its subdomains
 [01:37:59 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> ERiC NK GUESS WHAT
 [01:38:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ...?
 [01:38:34 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> well
 [01:38:35 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> ...?
 [01:38:44 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> it's more of a question, when's next release?
 [01:38:51 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> oh, the hell if I know.
 [01:38:54 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> finals.
 [01:38:59 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Well, Eric, it's like this.
 [01:39:00 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> you get tired of working on it?
 [01:39:06 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> i got those in 2 weeks
 [01:39:07 PM] <IdleBoT@Azeroth> wewt
 [01:39:09 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> You should get access to the entire FTP
 [01:39:13 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Why don't you?

 [01:39:24 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> What would I do with such access?
 [01:39:50 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> It's so you can manage the entire site, with whatever you need.
 [01:40:06 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I can manage the entire site with or without ftp access.
 [01:40:11 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> I'm just stating a very old plugin on the plugin system.
 [01:40:51 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> You have access to the admin interface, yeah..
 [01:41:12 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> The admin interface to stealthbot.net, not IPB, I mean.
 [01:41:18 PM] <Alendar[BoT]@Azeroth> ...
 [01:41:20 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Well
 [01:41:28 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Is that sufficient to what I want?
 [01:42:05 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> The IPB admin console controls the entire site.  It's the "admin interface."
 [01:42:34 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> Well, the forum, yes.
 [01:42:54 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> But it cannot act as a means of adding, and removing files.
 [01:42:58 PM] <To Bot-Vector@Azeroth> For all practical purposes, the entire site.
 [01:43:03 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> oh
 [01:43:06 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> ok
 [01:43:15 PM] <From Bot-Vector@Azeroth> But can you notify Swent for me?
