 [07:18:48 PM] <Alendar> When will we attack that?

 [07:18:54 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i can't...
 [07:18:56 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and not when the beta
 [07:18:57 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> so..
 [07:18:58 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i told you
 [07:19:01 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> what the logs saved
 [07:19:03 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [07:19:11 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the only thing that appears is 0x65
 [07:19:13 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> over and over
 [07:19:18 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> unless it's connecting
 [07:19:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> You don't have the knowledge to analyze packet logs.
 [07:19:27 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> but i know what it is
 [07:19:30 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and its the same thing
 [07:19:33 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> i sent it to you
 [07:19:34 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> :P
 [07:19:37 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Then you tell me what the problem is.

 [07:21:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> This is the entire log up until the moment of the disconnect?
 [07:21:54 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> yes
 [07:21:59 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Where are the C -> S packets?
 [07:22:08 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> thats what i sai

 [07:22:24 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Client events are likely at fault here.

 [07:23:18 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> want me to try logging with only 1 beta open?
 [07:23:19 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> I'd imagine that it's a problem with your connection to Battle.net, nothing more.
 [07:23:30 PM] <Alendar> Hmm.
 [07:23:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> However, I need a log that includes events C -> S so as to properly diagnose the issue.
 [07:24:05 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> about that...
 [07:24:09 PM] -- Alendar has left the channel.
 [07:24:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> they just arent there
 [07:24:12 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> lol
 [07:24:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Yes, your packet logger is filtering them.
 [07:24:27 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> What logger are you using?
 [07:24:32 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> the one inside the bot
 [07:24:39 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ah, that explains that then.
 [07:24:45 PM] -- Alendar [47ms] has joined the channel using Diablo II (Open Character).
 [07:24:55 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The in-bot logger has been temporarily disabled due to a redesign of the packet buffer.

 [07:29:47 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The text is sufficient.
 [07:29:51 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> ok
 [07:29:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> im not gonna do this tonight though
 [07:29:59 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> its gonna take too long
 [07:30:02 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> to get it to disconnect
 [07:30:04 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> and such
 [07:30:36 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> also
 [07:30:44 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> there are often a lot of problems with startup

 [07:54:02 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> teh fuxz
 [07:54:31 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i bet
 [07:54:31 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> yeah he just needed a new chainsaw
 [07:54:34 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> that
 [07:54:39 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> when 2.7 comes out
 [07:54:47 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> people aren't going to know what to do
 [07:55:02 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> umm
 [07:55:08 PM] StealthBot packet traffic will no longer be logged.
 [07:55:10 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> people hardly know what to do now..
 [07:55:16 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> How do you mean?
 [07:55:16 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> no i mean
 [07:55:25 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> like they will be so suprised that it actually came out
 [07:55:28 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> chaos intervention agency
 [07:55:32 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> they'll just stare at it
 [07:55:36 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> lol
 [07:55:37 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and like... poke it
 [07:55:41 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> with the mouse
 [07:55:44 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> but not open it
 [07:55:47 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> like "Woah, i can't believe it's finnaly released"
 [07:55:47 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> IS IT REAL
 [07:56:01 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> yes.
 [07:56:02 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> Finnaly
 [07:56:05 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> not finally
 [07:56:20 PM] <ifndef-tech@Azeroth> as a tribute to Vista, 2.7 should have a confirm or deny prompt after you type each message
 [07:56:26 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> "has it already been eleventy years?"
 [07:56:28 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> LOL
 [07:57:08 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> or change a file in the system folder to cause non admins get the Run as admin prompt
 [07:57:22 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> dood...
 [07:57:25 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> that's a good idea!
 [07:57:35 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> o.0.o
 [07:57:43 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> no, lets make the vista tribute plugins 20 gb
 [07:57:49 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> thats the real way to go
 [07:57:55 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> in true vista fashion
 [07:58:08 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and we should change all the functions
 [07:58:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> so nothing is compatible
 [07:58:20 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> right
 [07:58:21 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> a special plugin, that pops up about eleventy billion msgboxes all saying "2.7 YAY ITS ABOUT TIME"
 [07:58:28 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [07:58:53 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> should just keep popping up "Setting up 2.7... please wait"
 [07:58:59 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> lol
 [07:59:04 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> should do that on april fools
 [07:59:09 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> put a fake mirror up
 [07:59:10 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> that does that
 [07:59:11 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> and restart because of some random error
 [07:59:30 PM] <Alendar is currently: Awesome Current Project: Getting organized My website: http://alendar.net :->
 [08:00:05 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> now that i think about it
 [08:00:11 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> one thing i was going to use my website for.

 [08:00:22 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> just do

 [08:01:06 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> his does too
 [08:01:11 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> with alt-ctrl-del
 [08:01:17 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> or force shutdown :D
 [08:01:22 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> naturally..
 [08:01:26 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> not if it's run in kernel mode!
 [08:01:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Then you're screwed :)
 [08:01:51 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> uh
 [08:02:02 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> you should change the splash to a 1900x1280 picture of Andy
 [08:02:03 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> <3 the cord in the back of the computer
 [08:02:08 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> unless your on a laptop
 [08:02:12 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> then your screwed
 [08:02:18 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> unless you can take out the battery
 [08:02:20 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> battery.
 [08:02:33 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> sledgehammer works too
 [08:02:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The cord = potential harddrive damaging.
 [08:02:46 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> but if you cant take out the battery without having the laptop turned off
 [08:02:47 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> ... especially if your kernel died.
 [08:02:51 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> then your screwed
 [08:04:05 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> there are other ways to fuck up your computer, though.
 [08:04:08 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> thats a good idea for april 1st
 [08:04:13 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> 1) give vector vnc access
 [08:04:27 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> we should release 2.7 on april 1st
 [08:04:31 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> stall the release till after that, and send out a fake 2.7
 [08:04:34 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> people will think its a joke
 [08:04:40 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> but it will actually be real
 [08:04:41 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [08:04:48 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> yeah..
 [08:05:02 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> i can see it now, so many threads asking whats the catch
 [08:05:16 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> if i know that its going to be released soon
 [08:05:24 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> im going to make a topic in the testing forum
 [08:05:31 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> that says" 2.7 released tomorrow"
 [08:05:35 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and see how many people notice

 [08:11:06 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> agreed.
 [08:11:12 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> I intend to implement this some day.
 [08:11:29 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> I'll rewrite the entire bot in VBScript
 [08:11:34 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> something like miragechat
 [08:11:38 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> and make guis
 [08:11:39 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> And use an OCX to hide Stealthbot's window itself
 [08:11:39 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lawl
 [08:11:45 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> And make my own gui
 [08:12:06 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> The true stealthbot will be nothing but a VBScript execution tool, lawl.
 [08:12:21 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> JoeBot, built upon the StealthBot API
 [08:12:31 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> "Is that like CleanSlateBot?" "No, more like DirtySlateBot."
 [08:12:33 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i dont think its possible to connect to battle.net with the sb scripting system..
 [08:12:42 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Sure it is
 [08:12:47 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Hdx.ocx can make a socket
 [08:13:02 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> yea
 [08:13:07 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> well you have fun with that
 [08:13:20 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> :)
 [08:13:26 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> If someone paid me I'd do it for sure.
 [08:13:30 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> or you could just wait until eric ports sb to c# and adds profiles
 [08:13:40 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth>  [08:09:33 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Eric[nK], isn't NTFS a journaling filesystem?
 [08:13:41 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Of course.
 [08:13:58 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> OO OO
 [08:14:03 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> Custom time stamps
 [08:14:04 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> gogo
 [08:14:06 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> So, how do you kill your HD by unpluggin the power cord?
 [08:14:09 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> i hate the brackets
 [08:14:28 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> ScriptBot will require Stealthbot v2.7
 [08:14:33 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth>  [23:16:26.643] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> i hate the brackets
 [08:14:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Journaling file systems only record transactions.
 [08:14:39 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> lol
 [08:14:50 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Moreover, a journaling filesystem relies on its kernel to update the journal.
 [08:15:01 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> If the kernel dies, the journal doesn't get updated.
 [08:15:05 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> That's retarded.
 [08:15:15 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Window's kernel ALWAYS dies.
 [08:15:26 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> wait

 [08:15:34 PM] <VBScript@Azeroth> Do you wan't to tell me what's on your mind, PyroManiac606?
 [08:15:34 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Actually, such an occurrence is quite rare.
 [08:15:42 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> j/k ;p

 [08:16:17 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i never closed the chat session from like..
 [08:16:19 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> yesterday
 [08:16:23 PM] <Alendar> Tabs have been suggested but they were said to be used for "flooding"
 [08:16:28 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Queer eye for the straight guy?
 [08:16:36 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> eric said he may add them
 [08:16:41 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> o.o
 [08:16:42 PM] <Alendar> The only way the can be used for flooding is if you do what MirageBot did.
 [08:16:46 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Alendar@USEast, someone who uses SB for flooding is either A) retarded B) dedicated
 [08:16:51 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i can do it
 [08:16:54 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> watch
 [08:16:56 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> i choose B
 [08:16:57 PM] <Alendar> Make // send the command from all the tabs.

 [08:18:58 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Eric[nK], why would you give everyone 100 access?

 [08:19:42 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> That gets old pretty fast and, if it doesn't, /rem * isn't difficult.
 [08:19:58 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Meh, well

 [08:20:13 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> ...math 19017/856.6
 [08:20:13 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Stealthbot has proven to be pretty vulnerable in the past.
 [08:20:14 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> StealthBot doesn't have exploits.
 [08:20:15 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> like?
 [08:20:15 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The statement "19017/856.6" evaluates to: 22.2005603548914.
 [08:20:22 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> ew
 [08:20:43 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Eric, remember when I told RoMi to calculate the result of finding "CDKey" in "Main" of config.ini?
 [08:20:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> No I don't.
 [08:20:58 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> StealthBot did it in a very friendly manner.
 [08:21:08 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> Well, Stealthbot has/had exploits.
 [08:21:13 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> The "math" command has been patched.
 [08:21:34 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> I'm 99% positive there's at least one exploitable bug in Stealth's code.
 [08:21:43 PM] <Joe-Tech@Azeroth> I mean, the majority of it was written years ago.
 [08:21:46 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> isnt there supposed to be an override to allow the old math exploit to work? o.o
 [08:21:46 PM] <LuC1Fr-Tech@Azeroth> so get to finding it.
 [08:21:58 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> Joe: You're welcome to find it.

 [08:22:30 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> me and phix found one
 [08:22:34 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> it was kinda neat
 [08:22:51 PM] <Eric[nK]@Azeroth> So in other words, you're willing to concede that there are no exploits in StealthBot that you yourself are capable of uncovering?
 [08:23:09 PM] <PyroManiac606@Azeroth> i could find one, if i tried hard enough.
